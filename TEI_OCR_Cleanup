<p>On Monday evening of last week several of the ladies and gentlemen of the Presbyterian congregation met at the residence of Mr. G. Smith, who was recently married. A very pleasant evening was spent, during which Mrs. Smith was presented with two very pretty chairs and fancy table, and the following address :
Mr. O. Smith,
On this occasion of your marriage, we, the Presbyterians of Campbell's Bay and other friends, desire to express to you our appreciation of the way in which you have discharged the duties of organist in our church during the last six years. You have faithfully done you part and aided nut a little in the musical part of our so:  vices.
We feel that it would show ingratitude did we not express this appreciation in some tangible way. We therefore ask you to accept these chairs as a token of our friendship and + good will, and an expression of our good wishes for the future prosperity of yourself and Mr. Smith.
May God bless you both and grant unto you every blessing in the present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
Signed on behalf of Congregation. Campbell's Bay, Dec. 28th, '96.

<p>Our attention has been drawn to a typographical error which occurred in our report of Lily Cheese factory, in the issue of December 24th. The said report says that “the average price received by patrons for then milk for the season amounts to a small fraction over 60j cts. per 100 lbs. The correct figures are 50;</p>

<p>British Naval authorities are beginning to lw favorably impressed with Lord Char lee Beresford'a proposal for re-arming with more modern gurus the older battleship, which now carry inux-zfo-louding ordnance. The cost of this rearmament would amount to alxmt two million pounds, or about what it oasts to turn out a new latlleship and a new cruiser. Which of t he two forms of expenditure is likely to give the latter results is the question now before the admiralty.
There are at present six turret nhips in the British navy armed with muzzle loadersthe	Ajax. Agamemnon,
Inflexible, Monarch, Neptune Dreadnaught. There are ten central
lottery ships, whose principal armaments consists of mu/zle-loadeithe
Alexandra, Teeneraire, Sultan, Hercules, Superb, Sw if taure, Audacious vincible, Iron Duke, and Triumph, Since these types of vessels were constructed, quick-firing guns of small calibre have been invented.. whit makes it exceedingly problematical if the muzzle-loaders of these sixteen ships could in any future engagement be reloaded.
The breech-loaders can, of course, be loaded under cover, and nowadays vessels, whose guns, as is the case with mu sals-loading ordnance, have to le reloaded from exposed positions struck off the lists as sans valeur</p>

The way that Kootenay takes hold of old chronic cases of Rheumatism, and ride the system of the lurking poison upon which the disease exists, the endoraation by well-known clergymen, physicians and hospital executives of its cures, leads past all doubt as to its power to cure this disease.
