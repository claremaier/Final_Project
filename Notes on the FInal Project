#STEP 1: Downloading the Equity files 1887-1902
-in DH Box, created directory called Final
-in Final, created directory for Equity Papers, called Equity_Papers_1899
-I will put all my Equity papers in this folder
*I am going to use the papers from 1897-1902 (6 years) to see if there is an increase of French/English conflict in Canada from  before to after the Second Boer War begins in South Africa and there is a difference of opinion between the two groups about supporting the British troops. This will be especially interesting because without doing any research at this point, I suspect the Shawville Equity as an English paper within Quebec will have an interesting take on the matter.*
*Perhaps this will not even be in the papers, in which case I will focus on whatever the paper focuses on.*

*I recognize that six years worth of data is not a large sample, but I hope that the change will be great enough to notice over the five years. I also made this decision practically because I do not have unlimited internet and did not want to download a decade's worth of materials*

#Fail
-I used the weget command from Module 2, modifying it so it would take the 1897 files. I received the following error:

*I returned to the tutorial to see what I did wrong. It appears that I had to remove to "-A" and somehow I accidently added "âw" instead of just "w".* I replaced that command with:
wget -r --no-parent -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1897/

-it appeared to be working well, but the files were downloading very very slowly and then they opened to the original website location. Not what I wanted, so I cancelled the download and tried again, this time without DH Box, and on my local computer.

I tried: wget -r --no-parent -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1897/ -A .txt
*this finally worked - I am downloading each of the 6 years independently and verifying the files are complete and planted in the correct folders *
