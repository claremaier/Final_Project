Toward the end of the sixteenth century Spain was without question the greatest power in the world. She owned all that she now possesses, iu addition to Portugal, the kingdoms of Naples and of Sicily, the duchies of Mlithe Netherlands and the whole of the two Americas south of the thir-ty-fourt ly parallel, a dominion to which neither Great Britain nor Russia, nor yet the United States can be coin par-id in respect of iiotential wealth-yielding power. This empire, too, rested on strong foundations. U lusted in Naples for 200 years.

Only part of the Ibei-Lan Peninsula remains in her possession. Her population has dwindled to 17.000,000. She is threatened with the loss to the United States of her only two remaining colonies, the Antilles and the Philippines.

The success of
North American republic encouraged th« sorely tried inhabitants of Span-ish-America to take advantage of the difficulties in which Spain became involved with France and England m the first dteade of this century, and to begin wars of independence on their own account, and inasmuch am the conditions of affairs at Madrid at the time precluded the dispatch of re-enforcements to the various viceroys and Captain Generals, the rebellions attained such proportions by the time peace had been restored in the mother country, and trooiie were sent across the Atlantic to the Western hemisphere, that it was then too late.
But the Spaniards, despite the olds against them, made a stubborn fight, just as they have been doing in Vuba ; and although the war of independence began in Venezuela in 1810. it lusted without interruption, until 18l4, when Spain surrendered her last possessions on the American continent.

In fact, there is no explanation that can be furnished for the astounding decline of Spain unless it be that the inevitable advance of progress au * lightenment. even in Spanish countries has gradually awakened the masses to the injustice of their being oppressed and ground down for the benefit o e classes, and to the iniquity of extorting from the people the fruit of their labor for the benefit of favored and generally tilted drones. Spain, it must be confessed, baa from time Immemorial treated her foreign possessions as milch rows, to be drained of their last drop of milk for the sole advantage of those in power at Madrid, and h is not even practiced that place of pigmentary domestic economy, which consists in leaving something to the producer to serve as a kind of nestegg. She forgot, in fact, the principle inculcated by the Bible when it forbade the muzzling of the ox that thrashes
the corn.	. ,	.
Greed and cruelty are indeed the
chief causes of Spain's decay as agréa colonial empire. Her dei>endencies, tramar," that ifl to say, beyond the sea, besides being fleeced by the Madrid Government have been roblied w un-out scruple by the royal officials and administrators, all of whom have been Spaniards appointed by th<- sovereign. Spanish America, which comprised in the early part of this century, the whole of South America, with the exception of Brazil, the entire region of Central America, including Mexico, and more than a third of what is now the United States was divided into four vice royalties, bearing the names of Mexico, Peru, Buenos Ayres and New Grenada, and into three captain generalships, Chili, Caracas and Guatemala. These viceroys and Captain Generals were accountable only to the monarch of Spain, and exercised the moat autocratic and despotic sway, their word being law in all legislative, judicial and military affairs. Their terms of office were from four to six yeans, and they invariably returned to Spain with colossal fortunes amassed by nefarious means.

Some exhibition associations in Canada charge the exhibitor for the space he oc cupivs. Tho Central Canada Exhibition Ass oiatiua of Ottawa is not one of these. All spice is free. Moreover, manufact urers showing their machines are supplied wifi, motive power gratis, while fetd is supplied on the grounds to exhibitors of stock at current market prices. Staw for bedding is supplied by the Association free. The very best accunodation will be afforded all exhibitors this year. The buildings found small last arc being enlarged. Of course, the big change will be the new long, one story fireproof main building, but the additions and changes in the other buildings are none the less great and calculated to please bothexhibi tor and visitor. It is the same with the prizelist; more c'asser, increased values and additional specials. The directors believe in encouraging the men who spend so much time in raising good stock. All I classes are to be fou d in the pr:Z) list. The directors of Ottawa’s great show should be repaid for their efforts by the greatest attendance of stockmen in the history of the fair.
Already the fair directors have tecured a number of fine special attractions for the fair in September. Several of the best acroba‘3 and acrobatic comedians in Ameiica have been engaged for the Asso* ciation by an aient in New York, a cor. noisseur in such matters. One of tie specialists is Prof. Sutherland, a Roman trapeze artist, and he will undoubtedly astonish visitors to the fair with his act.

“I* had taken a great many remedies without receiving / any benefit, a friend £ induced me to try Idilburn'e Heart and Newt Pills.

Montreal, July 9.—The Semaine Re’i J bo seriously ill Reuse, of today, announces that the vie arate of Pontiac has been raised to a separate diocese, with Mgr. Lorrain as the first Bishop.
The Rt. Rev. Narcisse Zephirin Lor rain, titulary Bishop of Cythore and Vicar Apostolic of Pontiac (R C.) is the son of Narcisse Lorrain, by his wife, Sophia (loyer. He was born at St. Martin, Que.,
June 3, 1842, and was educated at the college of St. Therese and later followed the science course at Laval University (B. Sc. 1864). Ordained to the priesthood 1867, he became assistant director at Ste. Therese remaining there until his appointment as a parish priest of Radford, N. Y.,|jug. 1869.
As Vicar General of the diocese of Montreal, to which office he was called August 1880, he displayed such marked executive ability, that his elevation to the episcopate became only a question of time.
On the election of the new Vicarste Apostolic of Pontiac, July 11, 1882, he was nominated thereto by the Holy Ste, and was consecrated in Montreal Sept. 21, the same yeaç.
Since bin Lordship's appointment he has paid off the debt on his Cathedral, built an Episcopal residence, and secured many advantages and benefits for his people, which otherwise they would not have been able to procure. His energy of character received fresh illustration in 1884, and in 1887# in which years he trsv tiled many thousands of miles in s birch canoe to visit the mission stations in the
