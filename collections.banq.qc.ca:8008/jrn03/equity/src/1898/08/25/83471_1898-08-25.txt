In 1881 the total investment in electri cal appliances throughout the l nited States did not aggregate much over 000, while at the present time the total capitalization of electrical railroad, lighting and other concerns is put down as ful ly $1,000,000,000. The 14,000 miles of electrical rail made which exist to-day in the United States represent a capitalization, at its par value, of about $1,000,000,000 while the electric lighting stations and plants in the country are believed to represent an investment of fully $000,000,000.

Washington, Aug. 16.—The report from London that Count Cassini, Russian ambassador here, will shortly be transferred to London, excited much interest in diplomatic quarters, as it was felt to have au important bearing on the Chinese qu which has recently reached an acute issue between Russia and Great Britain.

affairs, as he was for five years Russian ambassador at Pekin, prior to coming to Washington. It was during hie service at Pekin that Russia executed the coup of gaining Port Arthur and part of the Liao Tung peninsula. The recent clash between Russia and Great Britain grew out of some of the British concessions made while Count Cassini was at Pekin. His transfer to London will therefore give his government the advantage of having the negotiations with Great Britain conduced by a diplomat thoroughly con versa n l w ith the conditions of Chinese affairs.

HAEDTS RETROACTIVE BILL
WILL REPAY INTENDING BUYERS,
estion
The Montreal Star, Independent, takes the following view of the bill introduced in the Ontario Legislature last week by Mr. Hardy, as a last and undoubtedly desperate means to bolster up his decidedly shaky position: —
“The Hardy bill, as finally introduced, «appears to be in accordance with the last revision of the Premier’s intention. It.doee not attempt to amend the law respecting the right the late elections, a shameless piece of retroactive legislation the perpetration of which Mr. Hardy did not venture soon after he had encounter ed the storm of protest which his famous memo, to the Lieutenant Governor called forth. Bui he does propose what is practically retroactive legislation. His bill, if carried, will change the conditions under which the last elections were “run."

Ou the supposition that the judges rule out the constabular vote, the election law, as it theu stood and still stands, would in all human probability unseat, several of Mr. Hardy’s followers in the Legislature, -aud give their seats to their late opponents. Mr. Hardy’s proposition is that the law shall be so altered as to only take the first of these steps—i.c., unseat the Liberal members -and then, in place of giving the seats to the men who won f:hem, order new elections. If this is not retroactive legislation, it will be hard to conceive of anything that is. An election is not properly over until its results are tested in the courts. A man is not elected who breaks the law in his race for the seat.

EXHIBITION
Hong Kong, August 16—Admiral Dew ey gave Gen. Augustin an hour in which to surrender, at the time of the last demand made on Sunday. General Augustin refused to comply.
The bombardment, which began at 9.30 a.m., was continued for two hours, and then the Americans stormed the trenches sweeping all before them.
Those within the walls attempted no resistance. The First Colorado volunteers stormed the outer trenches and drove the Spaniards into the second line of defence. Then the American troops swept on, driving all the Spaniards into the inner for ideations, where the Spanish commander, seeing that further resistance was useless, hoisted the white flag and surrendered.
The losses, American or Spanish, are not yet known. The Spaniards in trenches probably numbered 3,000 The American attacking force numbered 10,000 ; and the Americans were better armed, better trained and in better condition. The foreign fleets watched the bombardment with acute interest. American war ships engaged were the Olympia, Petrel, ltaleigh, McCulloch, Boston, Monterey, Charleston and Baltimore.

CARE OF THK TEAM IN SUMMER.
During the summer muni hs farmers and teamsters are liable to have more or loss difficulty in keeping the shoulders and necks of their teams from becoming galled and sore. The hotter the weather the more care Is necessary. With proper care and vigilance, much of the difficulty can be prevented. and prevention is better than cure. Ill-fitting collars and harness are a fruitful cause of sore shoulders and necks. The collar should fit the neck snug and tight, like a glove tits the hand, with room enough at the bottom to allow the open hand to pasa readily inside of it. To secure a perfect fit Is of the utmost importance. Frequently collars are purchased during the winter or early spring when the horses are in good flesh. With regular work the team loses weight and1 as a consequence the collars are too large.
