REPAIRED BY SHELLFISH.
A most curious use is being* made of
the common silky-heard mussel down
in a Devonshire. (Eng.) town. This is
at Biddeford, where a bridge crossing
the River Torridge is kept in repair entirely by the* mussels, says the Rambler. The stream is so rapid that it washes away mortar, so the owner employs boats to bring up mussels to fill the interstices. These mussels affix themselves to the masonry by a glut inous thread» which they exude, and so strong is this that, it is an effective substitute for mortar in the holding together of the bridge.

This protocol, it is true, is yet to be signed and is to bu submitted to the Spanish government before the formal signatures be affixed, but the administration's view as to the progress made today was set out today in Secretary Dav e remark: “It is expected that this protocol will be executed.”
There must be a delay, possibly from 24 to 28 hours, before tho next step can be taken, and the protocol made binding upon both the United States and Spain by the attachments of the signatures of the plenipotentariee, Secretary Day, for United States and M. Cam bon, for Spain. The delay will be attributable largely to physical causes.
As to tho character of the protocol, it can be stated on authority that the .terms are in all practical points those set out in the abstract of the President’s conditions published from the White House a week ago. From this fact it is deduced that the extra conditions or qualifications sought to be imposed by the Spanish gov eminent were abandoned at least in large part by the French ambassador.
Tho peace negotiations are now believed to be advanced to a point where the preai dent has felt warranted in turning his attention to the selection of the commis sioners to be charged by the L rnted States with the drafting of a treaty of So far as can be gathered, but

The Daily Graphic says:	“If this

The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail, who professes to divulge the terms of along existing secret treaty between China and Russia, says: “It is nothing like an offensive alliance. China undertakes to regard Russia as having a preponderating influence in all questions of commercial and internal politics; while Russia will support China against all “open door" demands. Russia finances China in internal developments; and China grants Russia preferential rates in certain areas: and railways built in tho joint interests of the two countries will be under Russia’s practical control.
“Russia will assist China in develop ing her military and naval forces: and China will co-operate with Russia as an ally. This treaty has been in abeyance since Li Hung Chang visited the Czar. That it has become operative at the pre« sent moment in respect to the Pekin Han Kow and New Chwang contracts is significant.

Tells of relief from suffering by Dr. Fowlers Ext. of Wild Strawberry.
There are many people martyrs to bowel complaints who would find Dr. Fowler’s Extract of Wild Strawberry a wonderful blessing to them. It not only checks the diarrhma but soothes and heals the inflamed and irritated .bowel, so that permanent relief is obtained.
Mrs. Andrew Jackson, Houghton, Ont, ¦ends the following letter:	•• For the
past two or three years I have been a
martyr tothat dreadful disease diarrhoea.
I tried every remedy hrl I heard of and spent a good deal of money ^¦trying to got cured but all failed until tUf I happened to read y of a lady who was cured by using Dr. Fowler's Extract of Wild Strawberry. I purchased a bottle and commenced taking it according to directions and was cured in a very eh time. I cannot praise the remedy too highly for what It did for me "
