familiar, and In which all agree. Nevertheless there are a good many people I who engage in dairying and who see in V> nay, or at least to act as though they thought that the business of milk j production was somehow an exception to the principles which are recognized as prevailing in other callings. The proportion of cows of the non-paying kind that are used in dairying is very large. Wo do not say that there is not growing improvement in this respect, for there is, but still much remains to be desired. We do not ignore the fact either, that the improvement hoped for must be gradual. Dairy cow's must be bred and developed in order to do well, and this is a work, of tinier It is.thercV fore. In no complaining vein that we write, but rather w ith a view of urging persistence in the work of improving dairy herds. No oowr should be kept for dairy pur poses unless she pays, and
•till a greet many of this kind are kept.
The fact Is productive of serious injury in two diiaction*: l>ne is that it makes the business of dairying unremunerative to the m.tn who thus permits himself to work at a loss, and the other is that it is a positive injury to the business at large by increasing the butter production *f the country, and thus lowering the market price. If all cows that yielded less thin 200 pounds of butter per year were taken out of the dairy and devoted toother purposes the price of butter would probably increase 50 per cent. Of course it is not Iteoonuvs wet, it should not be removed possible to make this general clearance immediately. Cover the horse with a of indifferent cows.

It is not easy to buy good cows, because those who have them do not care to sell them. Good dairy herds must, a rule, lie bred for rather than purchased, but even though this condi-tb>n»of affairs requires the dairyman to keep fewer cows than he would like to keep, a small numl>er of which all the Individuals» will pay a profit, will make more clear money for the dairyman than twice as many, of which one-half pay a profit and the other half are milked at a loss. The poorer cows are not only eating their own heads off but they are eating up the profits made by the better ones. Every dairyman should adopt as a fundamental principle in his dairy work the idea of having good cow's or none. On no other basis will the work of dairying be found remunerative.	'.

TO DESTROY CUT-WORMS
The theories about it are
CURIOSITY OF LAKE SUPERIOR.
THE CARE OF HARNESS.
Give the harness a good oiling at least once a year, says a writer: Take it apart so that every portion can be cleaned and well oiled. If the harness Is badly soiled, wash before oiling. Soak in sdttpeuds made by dissolving a small quantity of hard soap in enough water to cover the harness perfectly. Soak, then usd a stiff brush and carefully remove every particle of dirt, then rinse thoroughly in lukewarm water. Always dry the harness in a shady place so that the leather will not become stiff and hard. After the water has dried off perfectly, but while the leather is still soft, apply some good harness oil. '(After a couple of hours, if there be any superfluous oil left that did not penetrate the leather wipe it off or it will become sticky and accumulate dust which will not come off except by scraping.
See that every part of the harness
is mode strong enough for the heaviest pulling. If any part is weak have it repaired immediately. Hie very particular to have good strong lines supplied with strong snaps which work well. Have the collar well fitted to the horse before commencing heavy work. The shoulders of the horse may have changed since last fall, especially if it lie a young horse. In order to have a collar fit well, each horse must have Its own separate collar,, which should not he worn by any other horse, flee that the collar is always kept clean and properly fitted and with the use. of a little common sense the horse will not be likely to have sore ahouldera.
If caught in a rain and the harness
green, equal ports by weight in case of the former, or thirty ta one of poison in the flatter, has afforded almost perfect protection to the infested fields. Whichever bait Is used, it should lie distributed near the plants, late in the afternoon or early in the evening, so far as possible, in order to offer the greatest attraction to the cutworms.
Another very interesting and very sad thing about Lake Superior is t hiat it.never gives up Its dead, writes s
Whoever encounters
had, horns.
In the British Museum is the largest specimen of a human horn. It is eight inches in length and ornamented the head of a noble Englishman the seventeenth century a Mrs. Allen, of Leicestershire, England, had a pair of horns. Another Englishwoman of the same town, known as the beautiful Mary Davis, had a pair of horns,
which were regarded as an addition to her charms. She had them cut, off four times, but they grew again growth was presented to King Henry IV., oC France.
In 1887 M. Lamprey relates he found in the African territory of Ganimi several imposing types of horned men and women. One of these was a majestic-looking negro with two horns, which In his case sprang one from each side of the nose. A Mexican named Rodrigues is described as having a horn on the aide of his head about seven inches long, with three branches.
There are cases of similar horns being found on dogs, horses and hares.
Malpigh calls suoh excrescences "a nervous prolongation of the skin." Hie* achi calls them the result of a morbid secretion. They are in substance analogous to the horny growth of the human finger nails and the claws of beasts.

The ceremony was unique, General Miles and General Wilson, by a prearranged plan had been driven from the Ameriovn he dquarters at Port Ponce to Caea del Hey, in the city proper, where Consul Toro and Ulpiana Colon, the mayor of the city, awaited them.
The Bombero, or city tire brigade, was drawn up m La Piaca de Delicia, opposite Casa del Rey, and as General Miles and General Wilson left their carriages the fire brigade band played one of Sousa's marches, a guard in front of the building forced a way for the American generals, and through the cheering crowd they walked into the building, where they were presented to Consul Toro and Mayor Colon.
Consul Toro said to General Miles that the citizens of Ponce were anxious to know if the same municipal officers and system as had been vogue would be continued temporarily. He was assured that municipal affairs would not bo disturbed for the time being, and that the same local officials would serve, but it was explained that they would be responsible to General Wilson, os military governor, who would keep the city under a form of martial law oppressive to none.
General Miles and General Wilson then stepped out on the balcony to view the square. The crowd cheered wildly, and the two American generals hastily with drew. They received an ovation ns they made their way to the headquarters.
Mayor Colon told me after the confer euce that he was glad the Americans had come. The Island, he said, now would enjoy prosperity and peace, and the beat citizens wanted the Americans to take possession.

March 8, 98.
For the benefit of Canadian mothers, who have daughters who are weak, pale, run down or nervous, Mrs Belanger, 128 Rideau Street, Ottawa, Ontario, made the following statement, so that no one need suffer through ignorance of the right remedy to use:	“My daughter suffered
very much from heart troubles at times. Often she was so bad that she could not speak, but had to sit and gasp for breath. She was so extremely nervous that her limbs would fairly shake and tremble. Frequently she would have to leave school; and finally she grew so weak that we wero much alarmed about her health. I gave her many remedies, but they did not ceem to do her any good. •
Then I heard of Mil burn's Heart and Nerve Pills, and got a box of them, and they have indeed worked wonders with . I can recommend them very highly as the best remedy I ever heard of for complaints similar to those from which my daughter suffered."
Milburn’s Heart and Nerve Pills never fail to do good. They cure palpitation, faintness, dizziness, smothering sensation, wonknesa, nervousness, sleeplessness, anaemia. female troubles and general debility. Sold by all druggists at 6«.o. a box or three boxes for 51.25. T. Mil burn & Co Toronto, Ontario.

It was nearly twelve when they reached Old Chester.. Pleasant was quite cheerful again, and bubbling over with questions.
Mrs. Day was pale, and her whole body tingled and trembled. How familiar it was! The stone tavern with the wide porch; that had been her window, the one in the corner; she had sat there, in the painted rocking-chair, when Peter told her he wanted to marry her. And that was the church: right beyond it pvas the minister's house. She remembered that they had walked across the green in front of the church to go to the rectory. It suddenly came over her, in a wave of terror, that he might he dead, that old man! She took out the whip, and struck Captain sharply; he leaped forward, and the jerk fairly knocked the breath out of Pleasant, who was in the middle of a question. Elizabeth felt, poor woman, that she could not bear one instant’s more anxiety; if he were dead—oh, what should she do? He had been an old man , she remembered.
Captain went briskly down the street and Elizabeth was so weak with misery and apprehension she could scarcely stop him at the parsonage gate.

Among the grand adornments of the city of Paris is the church of Norte Dame, with Its great towers, and elaborate rose-window, and sculpturing of the last Judgment, with the trumpeting angels and rising dead; its battlements of quatrefoil; Its sacristy, with ribbed ceiling and statues of saints. But there was nothing in all that building which more vividly appealed to my plain tastes than the costly vestments which laid in oaken presses, robes that had been embroidered with gold and been worn by popes and archbishops

As our guide opened the oaken presses and brought out these vestments of fabulous cost, and lifted them up, the fragrance of the pungent aromatics in which they had been preserved filled the place with a sweetness that was almost oppressive.

PRACTICAL NOTES.
Verse fi. Elijah said unto him Elisha. Tarry, I pray thee, here. At Jericho, the largest city in the valley of the Jordan. This is the third time Elijah has urged Elisha to stay behind. Probably neither man knew distinctly and exactly what was before them, but God knew the end from the beginning, and step by step he reveals his plans. From Hoieb to Alel-meho-lah the older prophet had gone; then, accompanied by Elisha, from Alwl-me-holah to Samaria ; from Samaria to the Ekron highway highway
Gilgal to Bethel ; now to Jericho; and presently from Jericho to the region beyond Jordan. (1) So Godt knows our future, and' reveals our life’s paths one step at a time. This gradual revelation brings into bold relief Elijah’s awe in facing his future terrors and glories, and Elisha’s
persistent love. (2) They sin who tell us love can die. The Lord hath sent me to Jordan. About five miles from Jericho is a bend in the river where, according to tradition, Elijah ascended. Several of Elijah’s stopping places this journey were notable at once as schools of the prophets" (seats of those prophetic communities whose zeal did so much to maintain faith in Jehovah during dark years), and as strongholds of hostility to Jehovah. For instance. Gilgal is mentioned by Hosea and Amos as a center of idolatrous iniquity; Bethel was the shrine of calf-worship; and Jericho had been rebuilt
