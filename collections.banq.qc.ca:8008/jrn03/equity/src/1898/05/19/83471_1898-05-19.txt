For 16 years or more do one, with the exception of Sir Charles Tupper, possessed Sir John MacDonald's confidence to the same extent. Outside of parliament he undertook the work of organization for his party, and for a considerable period filled the position of chairman of the executive committee of the Conservative Union of Ontario. More than once he declined a seat in the Cabinet. Probably the chief reason was that he felt he could not af ford it. He made treble or quadruple from law what he would have received as a cabinet minister, and in the financial difficulties in which he was involved for a considerable time, he felt obliged to continue the practice of hie profession.
THE QUAL RIGHTS ISSUE.
When Premier Mercier of Quebec restored to the Jesuits the equivalent to the estates confiscated from them by France before tbe conquest of Canada by Britain and Sir John Macdonald's Government refused to veto Mercier s act Mr. McCarthy broke with his party in 1889. Although the Dominion cabinet did not see its way clear to veto the act, there was no doubt that almost the entire Protestant sentiment of the country was against the set, and while the majority of the Conservaties stuck to Sir J M-icdonald, Mr. McCarthy had their sympathy in hie opposition to the act.
From this time, Mr. McCarthy remained independent in politics, and became a powerful disturbing force.

The special was m charge of conductor Sam Kenney and made a quick run to Campbell’s Bay, where the party took boats to the Island, and thence stage to the mines, about four miles distant. At Calumet landing the visitors were met by “Capt” 11 McC. Ritchie, Supt. and Que bec Agent for the Company, and the Rev.
A . Picot to, the hospitable cure of St.
Anne's Parish.
The party at orce boarded the convey ancea in waiting, and subsequently reached "Si. Anne’s Shaft” about 11 o’clock. Overseer Walsh had just cleared up a "shot” which he had put in'on the surface outcropping of what is designated on the company’s plan as the "East Vein,” and was rewarded with most favorable and encouraging results. The blast threw out a large quantity of fairly rich mineral, and exposed a vein ot surprising richness. This is the vein to wards which the operations in the shaft are now being directed. Drifting has been commenced at a depth of 120 Rot with the expectation uf striking a large body of rich galena when the vein is reached, which will be within a dis- * 4Q tance of sixty or seventy feet, calculating g gO from the angle in which the vein dips.
One of the first things to attract the visitors’ gaze on reaching the works of the company, was the display of bunting float id g from the staff which surmounts

While there the visitors’ central point of attraction was at the recently made excavation at the east vein, hand, industrious (?) M. L a busily at woik breaking off prime nuggets of galena to carry away as mementos of a pleasant and profitable visit While thus engaged, Mr. Ltmcetield,—who, by the way, is the official photographer of the Intercolonial and Parry Sound Hallways, and an expert in his profession—took
several views of the group.
A hurried inspection of the other branches of the woik going on, and then the party took a circuitous drive of halt a mile to the ' ‘Bowie Mine, the latest and apparently most valuable acquisition of the G. C. M. Co. A start of men have bo.n engaged only about seven weeks on this location, yet they have in the neighborhood of 2000 tons of marketable ore to show as the result of their operations, besides a large quantity of concentrating ore. Mr. Longstreet, late aupermten dent of the Russell mine, is in charge of
tho work at this place.
The output of the mine has all been compactly piled, and presents what might almost be termed a brilliant sight, as the myriads of crystals it contains are caught and reflected by the sun’s rays.
Mr. Lancetield got his "machine” to work again several limes with good effect, but very discreetly gathered it up when he observed a miner approach the "hole” with several yellow things in his hands resembling candles. Mr. Longstreet had prepared to salute his visitors in the form of a dynamite explosion, but the former conveniently got themselves out of the way before that event took place. The iemit of the explosion, inspected immcdi-;—- tel y afterwards, showed that two or Arr!‘V° three tons of latent wealth had been dis-9.06 unbdd from its slumber of countless
centuries.
