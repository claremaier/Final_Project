It would seem as though the editor of of the Aylmer Gazette had taken inspira ? ion from the example of the “Arizona Kicker” man, and has therefore conceived the idea of assuming the post• mastership of Hull City. Having once secured the position, we fancy he will next be directing his attention to the institution of a “private giaveyard in connection therewith, lie says :—‘There are so many persistent applicants for the post mastership of Hull City, that the Editor of this progressive and go ahead journal is seriously considering whether r would not be the best solution of thud fH culty, to take the position himself.”

One American, who thought, as thousands of his countrymen do, that only Yankees can tight, fuund out to his cost at Trout Creek, near North Bay, last week that Canadians know something about it too. In a hotel at that place an American traveller for the Delta Lumber Co of Detroit, stopped in his biag about whipping Spaniards to remark that Canadians were little better, and then re hearsed the old story that if “Gatling Gun’ Howard had not appeared on the scene during the last Indian trouble tin- I iq [5 starved ha If breed a would have whipped jq 49 them. A Canadian, who was quietly n 05 reading a newspaper, dropped it at this | n ;;Q point to remark : “We can't tight, eh?" and throwing off his coat, had the Yankee licked and lying stiff in a corner be fore the astonished crowd knew what had happened.

Was Hearted Alive.

Montreal. May 1.—A terrible accident took place yesterday at St. Isidore Dj Laprarie, whereby a young girl named Eugenie Brais, was roasted alive. Accompanied by her brother, the victim went to one of her father’s fields. While in the act of removing and burning some dead leaves, the flames ignited her dress Before assistance arrived she was enveloped by the flames and was horribly burned. In attempting to rescue his sister, the brother Ferdinand had his hands badly burned and amputation of both will be necessary. Miss Brais was 20 years of age and was to have been married in three months time to a young and wealthy farmer of that locality.

Mr. Stephen Wescott, Freeport, N.S., found (Burdock Blood Bitters) a wonderful blood purifier and gives his experience as follows :	“I was
very much run down in health and employed our local physician who attended me three months, finally my leg broke out in running sores with fearful burning. I had thirteen running sores at one time, from my knee to the top of my foot. All the medicine I took did good, so I threw it aside and tried
when one-half the bottle was gone, I noticed a change for the better, and by the time I had finished two bottles my leg was perfectly healed and my health greatly improved,”
