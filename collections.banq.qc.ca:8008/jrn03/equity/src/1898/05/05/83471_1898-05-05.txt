Renfrew, where they took the 9.60 train for North Ray—their future home.
Arrived at Renfrew, the bridal party proceeded to the home, and enjoyed the hospitality of Mrs. W. J. Hendry, where a number of friends had assembled to welcome arid congratulate the young couple, and where a most inviting supper, prepated for the occasion, was awaiting them, and which all present heartily joyed.
Supper being concluded, a few hours still remained ere the bride and groom should take their train, and the intervening time was pleasantly spent in games and social enjoyment.
Mr and Mrs. Connelly were accompanied to the station by a number of friends, who, as the train steamed in, did not forget the observance of the time honored custom of throwing rice, and the bride and groom left for their future home amidst a veritable shower, carrying with them the hearty good wishes of their numerous friends.
That their future life may be one of happiness and prosperity, is the wish of
The Equity.

A leading English medical authority advises lettuce salad as a cure for sleeplessness, recommending that lemon juice be su instituted for vinegar in the plain dressing in cases of dyspepsia.
For years the women of XV it he rs-field, Conn., were famous for their beautiful complexions—a beauty which ascrilned to the onions they ate, tVithersfield being noted for its trade In those bulbs. Fifty years ago the girl who wished to clearn her skin was told to eat a large raw onion with salt before going to bed at night. Onions ire a well-known preventive of*scurry, and no ship bound for Arctic regions fails to include plenty of them lining lier storcslJBpM*||j6H*6 best of all, and stewed in cream or sliced raw in vinegar will be found an excellent aid to the digestion. Whoever discovers a means of deodorizing the onion will be a isiblic benefactor.
Dandelion salad is a good diuretic, and the good wives down south esteem it a duty to feed their families on turnip tops in early spring in order to fvurify and strengthen the blood.
The value of celery is well known as a nervine, though its excessive use is injurious in some diseases.
Mrs. Rorer entreats housekeepers wherever it is lossible, as it is always In cities, to have at leant one green vegetable for dinner every day "for the stomach's sake."
Baked apples and stewed prunes also take rank with pleasant medicines, and at. this season of the year, when fresh fruits are acostlyluxury.it Is a comforting reflection to the ordinary housewife that they are really more wholesome for her family.

Ti e arrival of the steel steamship Lynn at Depot Harbor is au event of great importance to the country in general, and this city in particular.
It is less than three months since the public was informed that Mr. John It. Booth was reaching out for a lake trade that would feed his railways, and that he intended to connect Chicago and the terminus of the 0;tawa Arnprior and Parry I 7 po Sound railway, with a fleet of steamships.
As usual with him, performance followed clore upon the heels of promise. Tho distance between Chicago and the sea board has been greatly shortened; the the largest ships afloat on fresh wa-er carry cargoes from Lake Michigan ports I 10.15 to Depot Harbor, and the Booth railway iQ 40 lines carry them to Montreal via Ottawa. 111.05 It is a great achievement, and worthy of m 30 the “great heads” of the Canada Atlantic, n 55
