The Winnipeg Free Press points out
the unfairness and stuffing that the Man- "
itoba system of preparing voters’ lists
permits, which system, with its unfairness, "
the provincialist majority at Ottawa seeks to adopt in federal parliamentary elections. The Free Press refers to the Sen ate’s action in giving an appeal to the courts against the decision of the unfair and partisan makers of these lists, and goes on:—
14 The Government resists this just proposal on the pretence that it would prevent their acceptance of the provin cial lists; but this is a mere piece of transparent humbug. The people will support the Senate in their effort to pre I vent the franchise from being corruptly manipulated.”
The Free Press is an old Liberal paper.
Its declarations show that the Govern ment does not have its own party with it in the extraordinary position it has taken.	^	I

Every person who does not have to pay storage on his money is familiar with the difficult problem of making a small income answer the requirements of these advanced times. Clothing is one of the unfailing necessities, and it costs a good deal in the course of a year—if you get the wrong kind. We don’t keep the wrong kind, nut that we are more honest than other merchant tailors, but our long experience has taught U9 how to avoid being “stuck” on poor goods.
This knowledge is necessarily of benefit to our customers, because the cheaper a merchant tailor can buy, the cheaper he can afford to sell.
“Cheap” doesn’t mean poor quality, however, for if it did would not be “cheap.” poor qualify goods, no matter what the grade.

ANGLO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE
Four days went by uneventfully, and 1 found we were making southing rsp-id-ly, so murh so that I reckoned another twenty-four hour* would bring the Hebe well within the parallel of w A g u Lbs* and actually not many lea from the a;m( of ocean in which I had fallen overboard from the Ante Uvjk*.

Lonely as it might be aft for the girl, I wished above all to refrain from anything that could bear the faintest re-Hemblance to intrusion. And I think I did right; although Helen seemed just the least bit offended with me. However, the weather generally kept so fine that 1 was able to stay on deck aft most nights. Wet or dry I would have done so, but that, once coming up, and finding me there in the rain, aha very decidedly expressed her intent ion of staying in it also, unless l either took shelter below with her or forward with Nan.

Il Would lyfHd the World In l«N«nrrfi oltd II» Drill* Would Hr If##.
What gigantic possibilities would enter the domain of the world’s politics, should the mooted alliance between Great Britain and the United States become nn accomplished fact I
With Spain, Fnance and Russia combined ngalnst this great union of the Anglo-Saxon race the latter would have a preponderance in the world which would practically render war i ailles ible and give an incalculable impetus to all the machinery of modern civilization.
The territory controlled by an Anglo-American alliante at its start would be 15,040,400 square miles, or 6,000,000 squares miles more than one-third of all the laud of the globe.
The population of this territory Is 456,064.0110, or 200,000,000 more than one-third of the globe's total inhabitants.
THE TOTAL WEALTH
of the alliance, exclusive of India, Would be over 1126,050,000,000.
The number of miles of operative railway is 256,246. not to apeak of 16,000 miles of steam and electric railways in operation in United States cities alone, enough to encircle the glol>e several times.
The projiosal of the United States to S])end a billion dollars on the enlargement and perfection of its navy would add unPther great asset to the alliance, and the completion by England of the ïuUroad through Africa, from Egypt to Cape Town, would contribute a link to the chain of empire of untold value and significance.
The annual revenue of the Angles-
Ame ricun alliance would reach the sum of $1,717,746,0(10 A faint concept tiou of tbis suhi can be gained from the fact that it weuld purchase 42,944,|-000.000 loaves of bread, a quantity of food which would keep three million pe* » pie from starving fur a period of over 14.315 days, or thirtyrnme years, with a fresh loaf of bread for every man, woman and child every twenty-four hours.
The tonnage of the merchant shifts
of the alliance would be 14,775,000 tone, wjiivh is an amounts equal to t ht* coin»-bined weight of all of thi» mhibitante of the Russ inn Empire, with thjse of France, the Netherlands, Egypt, Italy, Spam, Brazil, Portugal, Sweden, Nonway, Belgium. Switzerland, Greece, Denmark and Venezuela, allowing the average weight of men, women and children to lie figured at 150 pounds.
The total value of the imports for one yeitr into the territory of the alliance would be 4,170,500.0(H) this sum if converted into onei dollar bills and laid end to end would form a line of greenbacks over
555,555 MILES IN LENGTH, or sufficient to encircle the earth over twentyj-three times.
The total exports of the Anglo-American alliance would le over $3,573,»-454,500, nut including anything exported from Cuba, Porto Rico, Hawaii or the Philippines.
The total indebtedness of the a 11 iy auve would amount to ^7,664,500,000 or only onermtith of all the indebtedness of every country in the world cojru-puted in one lump sum, and which in 1898 amounts to $27,400,000,000.
The regular army of the Anglrt Americans would have a peace footing of 248,900 men, together with a uniformed and thoroughly organized and drilled reserve, which would easily bring the numlier up to 763,600 officers and men. These would be ready to fight in three days.
So complete is the volunteer system of England and America that 25,0000,000 men could be raised by them inside of three months. ,

He w stupid and ignorant, perhaps, but lie has apprehension enough to shoot straight, and to understand when be is told to advance or not to quit a post alive, and he never disputes nn order or complains.

TIihI I» I hr Ifrm nn Ottawa lady Applies to Dr. W muons* Rink Rills.
Among many in vicinity who have been benefited one way or another by the uee of Dr. XX il-1 lams' Pink Pills for Pale People, the Journal has learned of the case of Mrs.
Gilchrist, wife of Mr. T. V. Gilchrist, of Hint on burgh. Mr. Gilchrist keeps a grocery at the corner of Fourth Ave. and. Cedar street, und is well known to a great many people in Ottawa as well as to the villagers of this suburb of thft Capital. Mrs. Gilchrist states that while in a " run down " condition during the spring of 1897, she was greatly strengthened und built up by the use of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Speaking of the mutter to a Journal report-she stated that while able to go about at the time, she was far from well ; her blood was poor, she was subject to headaches, and felt tired after the sightest exertion. She had read at different times of cures effected by the use of Dr. William»' Pink Pills, and decided to try them. She was »*ne-fitted by the first box and continued their uee until she had taken five boxes when she considered herself quite recovered. Mrs. Gilchrist says that she always strongly recommend» Dr. Willie me' Pink Pills as a builder and strengthened when any of her friend» are weak or ailing.

The emperor answered, "Hail !" which the hopeful unfortunates took to mean that they were pardoned. Not so, for seeing that they delayed when the signal was given.
