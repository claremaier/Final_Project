Ontario newspapers are boasting of « frenk calf recently born in Marmora township, which was partly covertd with wool like a sheep, partly with feathers like a bird and partly with hair like a cnw. It was fearfully made—like the policy of the • Ottawa Government, to which, in many respects, it bore a striking resemblance.
There was a triplicity in this bird of sheepish calf that is only equalled by the duplicity of the Ottawa monstrosity.
If the Marmora hutch potcli—poor thing, it is dead now—were placed on a bill of fare, the diner who asked for veal ¦¦ .	-,

Nur wuuld ho be completely fl ib-ugasted than the ardent believer in the Liberal principles on finding that in this “business” cabinet of “all the talents” there are men who are self confessed prevaricators aid political tricksters.

very much from heart troubles at times.
Often she was so bad that she could not speak, but had to sit and gasp for breath.

not once did he touch foot on ihe land. And how were his perseverance and vigilance rewarded I On January 1$, 1805 the enemy broke away and swept off to sea. It effected a junction with the Spanish fleet at Cadiz, which Nelson had determined to prevent. I hen the allied force sailed to the West Indies with Nelson in pursuit. The chase continued back to Europe again without success, and Nelson thereupon left his ship and returned temporarily to England. It was not until October 5, 1805, over eight months after the French force had escaped from Toulon harbor that Nelson finally met it and the Spanish allies in battle off Cape Trafa gar.

How many shilling «hookers have been weaved around twins, we wonder I But however much fiction has been written on this subject, there is something extraordinarily strange and Interesting in cases of twins in real Jffti, which are far more common than most persons lelleve. We were oently greatly entertained during an Interview with a gentleman who has gone deep into the mibjeot from a scientific standiKiint. and who has gathered togel her some amazing instances of the resemblance of twins and Its amusing *>n.sequences, says a writer in London Tit-Jilts.
I have a couple of huge manuscript hooks filled with accounts of cases of twins, said this gentleman, and the majority of them are peculiarly interesting. Perhaps the most notable fact is the intense sympathy that sometimes exists between twins. For Instance, you proliably know that It very often happens that one twin will follow in health every detail of the health of the other—suffering the same complaints, disorders and diseases as the other. If not at precisely the time, very shortly before or afterwards.

An Irishman is too nimble to lie caught w h ri ho doesn't wish to be apprehended lighted to tell the following story as an illustration of the national elu-si venose :
An irishman, the son of one who had been hanged, having been asked how his father died, thus eluded the admission of the fact:
Sure, thin, my father, who was a very reckless man. was jlst «landin' on a platform haranguing a mob, when & part of the platform suddenly gave —way, and he fell through, and thin it was found his neck was broken.

Ahoui them, which I heard from their sister.
The twins had been parted for some six week»—one had (been staying in Manchester while the other had remained in Leeds. Well, one day, one of the brothers chanced to go to the railway station and came fare to fare with his twin, who had suddenly returned unexpectedly. The two met in a doorway, and so quickly that they both drew hack, fully convinced for the instant that they had mistaken a large mirror for the door. You can easily imagine from that fact the resemblance was strong.
On one occasion the brothers, just for the fun of the thing, decided to attend each other's office as each other, and the joke would have been perfectly successful but for the ignorance of the one of the other’s l>uxi- i ness and the dissimilarity of their | handwriting. Had it not been for | these two circumstances, I am quite | sure they could have fulfilled each.! other’s (usines# functions
