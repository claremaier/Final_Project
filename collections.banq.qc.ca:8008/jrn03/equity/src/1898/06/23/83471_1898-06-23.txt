A STONE CRUSHER.
WAGON TIRES

this is
more apparent. By the use of a six inch tire, the roadway will support, without yielding, twice the load which It could support with a three inch tire.
Narrow tires cannot lie too strongly condemned. They cut and grind the road, plow and upheave it. Wide tires on the contrary, are a benefit rather than an injury to the road inasmuch as they act as rollers to preserve a smooth* hard surface. In some localities wide tires are objected to under the argument that they increase the draft required to move the load. This may occur under certain occasional conditions of very wet ami soft poads. But wHyen wide tires are universally used this objection will disappear, as the increased draft is due to the ruts and mud caused by narrow# tires.
