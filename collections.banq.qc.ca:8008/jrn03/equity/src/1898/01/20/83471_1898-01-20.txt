MRXU'AN DRAWN WORK.
To the h uwwife who prides herself on Uie lavish ootupleteiwee of her ta t>le dévora t i* ns. next to the displays of fine china the display of Mexican drawn lave work is most attractive. This drawn linen work, made hy hand slowly and with infinite patience by the Mexican senorltas, is of aiu h exquisite fineness and design that it is impossible of imitation hy the women of other countries, unless pvrhapa, t»y the women of thj I'nrkoh harem. It is the primitive la e making, and is therefore not original with the Mexican. hut it has been developed to the greatest perfection l>y them Alexi* an women ielect the finest and most, even linen, and draw the lines lengthwise and crosswise of the goods in squares and obbngs. with tiny
blo\ks of the material interspersed then with needle and thread the lace maker draws the threads that are le!t uncrossed in the linen, into designs o* spider web fineness and fancy. In former years it was only the woman of the h gher classes that employed their time in luce making but n<«v it is the every day occupation of th* peasant women of that country, and so great is the demand for Mexican drawn work that some stores handle it exclusively. American women hove discovered that however leautlful the tray and lunch cloths the center pe<es etc., may l*e in the plain drawn work they van still further emNdlish them with their own clever fingers by embroidering in the plain centers w hat ever design or favorite patterns they please, with a result that is more satisfactory and lasting than if I heir work had leen done upon th* cheaper "lamp'd goods, usually purchased at the stores for the purpose The list of articles to chnote from is almost unlimited, doilies, tray cloths, table scarfs, lunch cloths, napkins, pillow slips, center pieces, handkerchiefs, late f * ?r fine linget ie and even I aby dresses and the price range from 25 cents
to $1.50.

A WORD ABOUT ICING
With any of ua it is almost Impossible to get confectioner’s sugar, unless we send to the city stores for it, but a lady who uses ordinary powdered sugar and cornstarch says it is just as good. Her way of using is this With one cup of powdered sugar mix thoroughly a rounded tablespoon of cornstarch, then wet to a smooth icing with two tablespoons water or milk, and flavor to suit. The ingredients ___ simply mixed together and spread with a wet knife. It is claimed that if a cake is lightly rubbed over with flour before spreading with Icing of any kind it will overcome the ten-

At the present time the country of Russian Poland' in the watershed of the Dnieper, is being actively surveyed toward this end. and early next year it is. exgiected that the work of constructing this gigantic canal will begin.

As already remarked this is to be regretted, because it is patent to everybody interested, that if the course entered into is persisted in to the bitter end, all will suffer by it to » greater or lesser degree. This was pointed out very clearly by Mr. Poupore, who was invited to come and lay his views of the matter before the Board.
