"If it is Elodie w bo calls herself Mrs. Dighton. and she live* at No. 3," »he said to herself : "I could not do better than take rooms at No. 4."
She told the driver to stop there; and, after a pleasant interview with the good-natured landlady, she agreed to take the pretty suite of rooms for Soane weeks at least.
"How long do you expect to remain, miss ?" asked Mrs. Baltes, anxiously.
Audrey answered that it was quite uncertain; it might to weeks or months. The landlady, however raised no objection; and Audrey dismissed the driver, and sent Mrs. Dai tvs' servant with a request to the railway officials to forward her luggage.

CHAPTER, XII.
Audrey was in her pretty drawingroom overlooking the sea. Hto sat near the open window,, watching the waves as they rolled in. the golden gauds as they glowed wet in the sun, the little children as they played, the roses in the garden as they bent their fragrant heads the pretty sprays of mignonette. A feeling of rest as well as loneliness came to her.
It was all so calm, so peaceful, so still. Since that fatal morning when she had read her hu*l>and\s story her life eeenied to have hurried on. One event had rapidly succeeded another. Still she had never been alone; her gentle mother had always been near her. Now she was a stranger in a strange spot. It seemed to her that she had nevei* been alone before—had never known what real solitude was until now. She almost forgot for the moment why she was there.
Looking at the clear, bright sky. many thoughts came to her. Had she really done what was wisest and tost? To her pure and steadfast soul came deadly doubts and temptations. Had ¦he done right to leave the man whom ¦he loved so entirely ? How he had pleaded with her I He had left his very ¦oui, he said In her hands ! He had prayed her to remain beside him, as though she were the good ajigel of his life. He had told her that his very hope of Heaven went with her. Would it not perhaps have been better to remain with him, and leave matters as they were?
F he looked at the blue sky; but no answer came from it—the heavens were as brass. She looked at the restless sea; no voice came from the waves. Then she roused herself.
"I know that I have done right," she ¦aid; "no one may do evil that good may come."
Many were the conjectures formed In I be village as to the beautiful lady with the sorrowful face who had cornel to No. 4 Medina Villas. She was not married—her name was Miss Brooke— and the gossips wondered among themselves whether she belonged to the Brookea of Devonshire or to the Brookes of Forest Dean. It was such a beautiful face, but so sad, so sorrowful. Every one agreed that she must have had either a aevere illness or some great trouble.
Audrey was very careful at the beginning of her inquiries. There was nothing that kindly Mrs. Dattes liked better than a chat with her lodger. It was from her that Audrey heard first

The way that Kootenay takes hold of old chronic of Rheumatism, and rids the system of the lurking poison upon which the disease exists, the endorsation by well-known clergymen, physicians and hospital executives of its cures, leads past all doubt as to its power to cure this disease.
The New Ingredient, that works so marvellously in searching out stubborn and chronic rheumatism, is just as effectual with most any other chronic disease. Hopeless cases of Bright’s Disease yield to its influence, Eczema, in extreme forms where eruptions have existed from head to foot arc in its records of cures.

I, Wm. H. Wht, residing at 47 Hnghson Street North, in the City of Hamilton, do solemnly declare that I have been aflicted with rheumatism for seven years, and at different times confined to the hospitals both in Hamilton and Toronto Was discharged from the Hamilton hospital after eleven months' trsatment, and on the 15th of January last I was told that they could do nothing for me. When leaving there I was scarcely able to walk. I tried a number of so-called cures ; had my feet covered with fly plasters under directions of a physician, but got gradually worse. On the 18th day of this month, after taking two and one-half bottles of Ryokman’e Kootenay Cure, I threw away my stick which I had been compelled to nee for support, and am now a healthy man, free from all ain, after seven years' suffering. On Tuesday last my feet for eighteen hours steadily without any bad results. I am now able to attend to my work regularly, which frequently necessitates my hands being in water for hours. I cons Kootenay the most wonderful blood medicine and Rheumatic Cure ever known Wm. H. Why.
