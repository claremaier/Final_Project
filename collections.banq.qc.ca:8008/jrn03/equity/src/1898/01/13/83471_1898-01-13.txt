I I, Wm. H. Why, residing at 47 Hugheon Street I North, in the City of Hamilton, do solemnly de I olsre that I have been afflicted with rheumatism I for seven years, and at different times confined to I the hospitals both in Hamilton and Toronto Was i I discharged from the Hamilton hoeeiUl after eleven 1 I months’ treatment, and on the 13th of January last I waa told that they could do nothing for me. When leaving there I was scarcely able te walk. I tried a number of so-called cures ; had my feet covered with fly plasters under directions of a physician, but got gradually worse. On the 18th day of this month, after taking two and one-half bottles of Ryekman’s Kootenay Cure, I threw away my stick which I had been compelled to use for support, and am now a healthy man, free from all am, after seven years’suffering. On Tuesday la^fc was on my feet for eighteen hours steadily without any bad results. I am now able to attend to my work regularly, which frequently necessitates my hands being in water for hours. I consider Kootenay the most wonderful bkod medicine and Rheumatic Cure ever known Wm. H. Why.

To Live we must Eat—that is everybody's business.
To make good Bread—that is the housewife’s business.
To make good Flour—that is the miller’s business.
A trial trip to these mills will convince one and all that our millers understand their business.

Besides all this, it must be a pleasure for farmers to know that after driving I some 20 or 30 miles that they will have no trouble to get their load exchanged with* out delay, the supply being large enough to supply all demands from the four counties who so generously patronize these mills.
The capacity of our Provender Mill is 80 to 100 bushels per hour.
We have also one of the Best Buckwheat Milling Plants in Canada, having a capacity of from 40 to 60 barrels per day.
XVe want your trade and if good Flour and generous treatment count for anything we will have it.
