TO CLEAN SMOKY PAINT.
Many housewives have no doubt been
greatly annoyed when cleaning the
paint in the kitchen to find it would
look streaked and cloudy, especially if
an oil or gasoline stove had been used.
A very easy and satisfactory w y to
cleian it is to sro over it with kerosene which removes the smoko, then wash in soapsuds, linse it in clean water and wipe with a dry cloth; the effect is surprising.

BLANKETS.
It is well to look over the supply of blankets and see what we wish to do with them before the winter weather is upon us. A blanket seldom gets so badly worn that the pieces cannot be us«d. Th^y usually wear thin in the middle first. Out them in two lengthwise, turn the se>ldge edge toward the middle, and overhand together just am you would a sheet. Finish the -cut edges with buttonhole stitch, fusing any kind of yarn you happen to have. This will greatly lengthen their period of usefulness.
If worn uniformly throughout. It will make a good lining for a woollen comfort, or the best pieces of several may be joined together with flat seams

Certain it is that although forty years have passed since he was marooned in the mysterious manner described, he has never conveyed to any living l*eing by speech a single thought.
There was not a letter or paper of any kind nor marks on his clothing to give the slightest clue to his name, home, nationality or history. The people called him “Jerome," berau e they thought some of the sounds he made with his voice resembled that, I but except for this he has remained for forty years a man without a name.
In time the poor people of the village felt they could no longer hear the burden of the waif's maintenance, and they applied to the authorities to relieve them of him. The Poor Commissioners of Digby county did not ere why they should bear the load. He certainly was not a Digby county man. I They accordingly applied to the Legislature of Nova Scotia to take care of him. Pending investigation the Leg-*| islature appropriated the sum of $104 for his maintenance. Investigation failed to discover any’ more than was already known, and the grant was continued year after yean
