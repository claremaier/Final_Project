The chief feature of the session was the	7 seriously con-
masterly speech of the Hon. Mr. Foster, *'d"T wh»‘route was best to adopt as a
Finance Minister's speech : —
H is speech was a masterly and compre hensive review of the question from an Opposition point of view. Despite the fact that many of his argumenta after a five xvet*k debate necessarily bore an aroma of antiquity, he held the attention of both ailles of the House throughout.
Mr. Foster maintained there were two important points that should have been considered. One was to secure the best permanent route, and the other was to dispose of a public franchise in a proper way. He scored the government for giving Maim & Mackenzie the Stickeen franchise in the manner they had, and held that in all cases when such import ant franchises were to be disposed of, tenders should be called for, and the benefits of public competition secured for the country.
Taking up the Hamilton Smith offer, he questioned whether the prime minister had acted in the matter as one gentleman should act towards another. He scored I the Premier for wiring the Canadian Commissioner at London to find nut
whether Mr. Smith represented the I llotlihcliilds instead of first a-king Mr.
Smith himself, and held that the Pre tmer’s action in refusing to give the House the telegram of inquiry he sent was absolutely inexcusable. The First Minister claimed the telegram was a private one, but there could bo no such a thing as a private question when the subject was a public one and the answer published broadcast by the government.
The only conclusion that could be come to was that the inquiry had been ini properly worded. “1 am my own keeper of my own honor,” the first minister had said. Then for God’s sake let him be his own keeper.
The premier’s broken promises had be come a by word in the country. “What public pledge,” said Mr. Foster, “has he made that he has not gone back on ? And even a private pledge that he gave across i the floor of the House, knowing very well every condition of it, when he wakes up the next day he comes and repudiates it, and says he will keep his honor in his own charge.”	|
