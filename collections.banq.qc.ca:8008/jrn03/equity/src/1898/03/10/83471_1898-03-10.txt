Quebec Has 0-old
Inverness, Que., March 4 —Considerable excitement lias been c;«U/md in the county of Megantic by the discovery of gold on the banks of the Bullard brook The discovery was made late in the au. tumn, and i.i consequence of the ground being fr zen and the unusual depth of snow there has not been much prospect mg. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, several pits have been sunk, and in every case gold in small quantities has been found in the black sand that seems to be scattered over the whole of the flats, which compose the banks of the stream. Several capitalists have visited the locality, and some good « ff rs have been made for the property on which the discovery was made, but the proprietor does not seem to be disposed to share his good for tune with others. Experts says the diggings exceed in richness anything that has been discovered in the Dominion, other than the Klondike.
