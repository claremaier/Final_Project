The unfavorable weather did not prevent a meeting of the teachers in Shaw* ville academy on Saturday the 12th inst.
Mr. Pollock, B A , Principal of Ayl mer academy was present and read an essay on “ School Economy,” or how to spend the time to the very best advantage. Three points were considered. 1st, Thorough Grading ; 2nd, Time Table ; 3rd, Good Discipline. Stress was laid upon the fact that it was the right of the teachsr alone to classify. A lengthy and profitable discussion followed.
A paper on Composition was given by Miss Matheson After a short discussion an excellent reading was given by Arch deacon Naylor, entitled A Song of Triumph, by Rev. Fred Scott.

St. Patrick’s Day was fittingly celebrated by the citizens of Chapeau, who enjoyed a first elkss concert in the town hall on that evening. The programme rendered was a very elaborate one, comprising popular Irish songs, solos, instrumental music, dialogues, comedies, etc. The attendance was large. A programme of the entertaiment in detail has been received but unfortunately too late for insertion this issue.

The detectives left Bryson at 4 in the afiernoon for the premises of another named Toner, who lives at Payette’s mountain, Upper Litchfield	|
pod at Mrs. Hurley’s hotel, Campbell's Bay, where an exchange of horses was made, then proceeding on, reached Toner's about 7 o’clock, encountering on the way considerable hardship owing to the rain and wretchedly bad state of the road. To make matters more discouraging nothing was fouhd at Toilet’s in the foim of whit-key or the appliances for making it. But the admission was gained that they had made some four or five years ago. The party then bought an old lantern from Toner and started off, but although they had yet other regions to explore, they soon found it would be impossible, owing to the rain and darkness and bad travelling to proceed further with the search that night. They accordingly headed the team for Campbell's Bay, and reached there at 11 o'clock ; here they exchanged teams again and then went on to Bryson. Arriving at McVeigh’s hotel at 12 o’clock it may be taken for granted the trio were in excellent humor to enjoy a hearty supper.
At an early hour on Sunday morning they started again for Payette’s mountain, the objective point being the domicile of Jimmy Larue. It was intended to visit Jimmy on Saturday night had conditions been favorable, and it is just possible this setback to the prog have interfered with the expedition terminating as successfully as it would otherwise have done.
Arrived at Larue’s, which is a couple of miles from Toner’s, Detective Floody at once began a search of the house and rded with the discovery of
