Following the heavy thaw which lowered the depth of enow in this township about eighteen inches, and which interfered with our jobbers' hauling operations, came a few days of very severe weather. The clerk of the weather no doubt had syui]>&thy with our jobbers, for without the cold a nap they would have had â very hard time Indeed. Our many lakes after the thaw were covered with water to such an extent that with a team it was nearly impossible to cross them, consequently the jobbers* spirits dropped like shot in a water bucket. But, lo ! the wind suddenly changed to the north and in a short time the lakes were a solid sheet of ice ,and the roads became first class.
