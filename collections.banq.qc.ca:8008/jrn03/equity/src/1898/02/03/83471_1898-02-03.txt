The poem 44 Sixty Years Ago,” which appeared in The Equity on the 26th November last, has been considered sufficent-ly meritorious to earn for itself a place in the columns of a large number of our ex ji , | changes, since the above date. We ob serve, however, that as the scope of its publication increases it is also undergoing sundry changes, in order to suit the cir* corostancs of one particular locality or another, so that the original form in which it came from the pen of its authoress is gradually disappearing. The latest re print of the poem In a decidedly mangled form appears in last Saturday’s Ottawa Journal, and is credited to The Brockville Times, whoee editor by a glaring substitu lion of words and transposition of stanaas has made it in his opinion to apply admirably to the conditions of the town by the St. Lawrence some three score years ago.
