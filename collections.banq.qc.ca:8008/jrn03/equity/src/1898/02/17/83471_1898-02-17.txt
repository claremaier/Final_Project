Frank Pratt is firmly convinced there is Home mystic tie of pre-natal sympathy that links him to his brother. They have lived together as perhaps no two , | brothers ever lived before. Until they were twenty five years of age they were never parted for a single night. Frank Pratt believes that perhaps if they had separated when they were children, grown up under different environments. the|r might have had quite different prenonalities. He thinks they might not only have had different minds and morals, but that they would probably have come to he dissimilar, in physical appearance The mere ab-sen e of a few months seemed to make ' quite a difference in them, hut the balance mils restored again as noon as they were together.
