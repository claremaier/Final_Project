After a somewhat lengthy trial, in which a great deal of interest was manifested, Recorder Champagne of Huil, on Friday morning last, committed Andre Riopelle to stand hia trial before the Court of Queen’s Bench, on the charge of complicity in the death of Leus Boyer, of Black Bay, Eardley.
Recorder Champagne, when rende: ing judgment, carefully reviewed the evidence adduced. He laid tpecial stress on the action of Andre Rie pelle the day after the tragedy. ‘‘Take any man said the recorder, “who has lost his travelling companion, what ia his first duty if he ia at all friendly to him? I is invariably to go arid look for him at the earliest possible opportunity. That is exactly what Riopelle did not do in the case of Boyer. Moreover he went and told a very different story of what he knew to the deceased s parents. Hm showed on that occasion criminal neglect. That is the main fact of the case."
The recorder concluded:	44 It is my
painful duty to commit the prisoner to stand his trial before the Court of Queen’s Bench."
The prisoner turned pale at this sentence and answered to a last question put by the court that he was innocent.
