And yet, Sir Thomas is withal a merry millionaire. His years of close attention to business have not allowed him time to grow cynical. He has l*an described as "six feet of raw boned optimism.” Him laugh is hearty and in, feet ion». His blue eyes are kindly HIS HUMBLE BEGINNING. and twinkle with good humor. He is a Sir Thomas’ father, whose name generous, big hear bed, shrewd headed was also Thomas—''Tammas” it was bachelor, who does not allow his $50,-—when spoken—was a Glasgow work- 000,000 to influence the promptings of man. He was too poor to send his boy his heart, but rather looks upon his to school. There were no such lux- wealth as a means of gratifying a for little "Tommy.” At the age | natural inclination to communicate of ten, he was a messenger boy in a stationer’s shop, and it is on record that more than one of his message® forgotten as he loitered along the docks, looking at the ships and building castles in the air as to what he would do when he became rich. His salary was sixty cents a week.
For two or three years this went on, but one day "Tommy” disappeared.

The lumber industry of the Dominion has assumed great proportions since the destruction of the forests of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, and much of the material used in the United States is from the country to the north. The lumber exhibit is interesting as well as instructive, both on account of the numerous samples and the character of the exhibits. There are some oak, pine, poplar, birch, hickory, walnut, maple, cedar and a score of other varieties of the woods of the forest. One of the most interesting is a slab cut from a log of hard pine.

Judging from what has transpired at Quebec, and elsewhere, the fanning, and saw milling, the pulp and paper and the fishery interests of the United States arc opposed to reciprocity that would increase Canadian compel tion with their pro ducts. The Canadian inducement to reciprocity would bo a larger market in the United States for just these products.

If anybody has been hoping for general reciprocity of trade between Canada and the States as a result of the Quebec conference, he would do well to put that hope on the shelf. There is not going to be auy reciprocity.—Hamilton Heraid (Ind )
The Czar’s project of universal peace is described by a continental critic as an idle dream. But looked at from another point of view it appears a thoroughly practical proposal. Russia has got all she want# in China, and has goaded Great Britain to the verge of war. What could be more natural and politic] than Russia, being notoriously unprepared war, should say, “ well now, let's be friends; what’# the use of quarrelling? ”
The Czar makes no mention of giving up y of the advantages recently acquired.
