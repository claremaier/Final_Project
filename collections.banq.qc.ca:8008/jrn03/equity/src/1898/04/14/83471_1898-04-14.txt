METALLIC MATERIALS IN BUILIX
INGS.
In all sorts of farm constructions tal is rapidly taking precedence over ether materials ; and steel, which Is the strongest metal in common use, is now extensively used not only for parts of buildings, ns roofs, but for every part except the floors. Tin was once the beat material for roofs; it is now nearly thirty years since I had a tin roof put on my dwelling house, and it has never needed any repair except to renew the iron oxide paint first applied to it. ' This has been done only twine in that time, the reason for its durability being that as it Is a metallic substance and makes a chemical compound with the oil, its adherence to the tin is perfect, and being an oxide It Is not. affected injuriously by the oxidizing effect of the atmosphere. The steel roofing plates, which are made in large sheets already painted, are even better, says a writer, than tho tin now to be procured. Tin plates are now nothing like what they used to lie. as every one who uses tin pans and palls discovers to his sorrow, when only after a few months' use the bottoms rust out, because of the exceedingly thin and imperfectly applied coating of tin on the iron

Arnprior,—"I can certify to the beneficial effect of Dodd's Kidney Pills m cases of Rheumatism as I have been helped greatly by their use. and I feel confident that others will derive equally as much benefit from their use as I did, if they use them according to directions/’-Rev. W. L. Rowan.
This is the testimony of a prominent and popular clergyman, stationed in Arnprior. His evidence must be accepted by all who read it, amd it establishes at once the efficacy of Dodd's Kidney Pills in cases of Rheumatism.
Dodd's Kidney Pills have cured more cases of Rheumatism in Canada and cured them permanently, than any I half-dozen other remedies together have cured. This claim is made emphatically for it is true. No case of Rheumatism is so bad that Dodd’s Kidney Pills cannot cure it.
Dodd’s Kidnev Pills are the only cure earth for Bright's Disease, Diabetes, Dropsy, Rheumatism, Gout, Urinary Troubles, Blood Impurities, Diseases of Women, Stone in Bladder, Heart Failure, Paralysis and all other forms of Kidney Disease. They never fail.
