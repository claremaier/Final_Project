From the Evening News. Detroit,, Mich.
I No woman is letter lilted for nursing. or has hu«l more yean of praotl-! oal exierlonec iu tjmt work than Mrs.
I Moats Morris, of 840Fourteenth street, j Detroit, Mich. For twenty years she has Iwen recognised as the liest and I most successful nurse in confinement I oases, and over three hundred happy j mothers can testify to her skillful nursing and rare months ahead, *be ham hundreds of pressing and pleading applications for her services made a specialty of confinement cases, and has made so high a reputation in this city that her engagement, in all cases, is taken as a sure sign of the mother’s speedy recovery.
Mrs. Morris was a nurse in Kngland before she earns to America, and so was her mother and her mother's mother before her. W hen asked once by a leading physician the secret of her great success in treating mothers in confinement cases she said she used Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, in such oases, as they build up the mother more quickly and surely than any other medicine she had ever used.

clear away all doubts as to the efficacy of Milburn’s Heart an Nerve Pills from the minds of the most sk ptical :
41 For several yea I have been a constant sufferer from nervous headache, and the pain was so intense that sometimes I was almost crazy. I really thought that my head would burst. I consulted a number of physicians, and took many remedies, but without effect I noticed Milbnrn'e Heart and Nerve Pills advertised, and as they seemed to suit my case I got a box and began their use. Be'ore taking them I was very weak and debilitated, and would sometimes wake out of my sleep with a distressed, smothering feeling, and I was frequently seized with agonizing pains in the region of the heart, and often could scarcely muster up courage to keep up the struggle for life. In this wretched condition Mil-burn’s Heart and Nerve Pills came to the &nd to-day I state, with gratitude. I
