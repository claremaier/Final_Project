GOOD JUDGES.


Railway companies are especially good judges of firm fences. Their object is to get a perfectly stock-proof fence at the least cost, and they investigate thoroughly before buying.
It speaks well for the Page that it is now used on all of the leading railways in the United States, England
and Canada. At this time we have orders booked from railways in Canada flor 270 miles of our fencing, all to lie shipped this season. And this fence is just as good for farmers as for Tail-road companies.

H"U. John firyden, Minister of Agi.' culture, has issued a circular warning the butter producers of Ontario that the increasing use of preservatives in the mak ing of butter for export to Great Britain from certain countries, particularly Au**» tralia, has excited so much attention in the old country that the exclusion of butter in which preservative material may be found is being proposed.

Vancouver, F». C , April 25. The Pro vincial Government supp >rters got together Saturday to pass a resolution favoring subsidising by the Province to the extent of #1,000,000 to McK *uzie & Matin to aid them in building a railway from a British Columbia port to Teslin Lake. However, a number < f people who oh jected to the scheme attended and made things lively for a time. They submitted an amendment that the Dominion or provincial should build a line as a govern ment work and not- subsidize any indivi dual. The amendment was however de fcated by twenty votes, and the résolu tion carried. Tin* original resolution was amended by a string being put on its tail directed against United States miners and Chinese.

FIRED ON THE FLEET
Havana, April 25. — Moiro Castle opened tiro on iho lighting squadron of the United States Friday night at eleven o’clock. A hi ut ten shots were sent in the direction of the American ships, biv not one of them took eff et, and no shots were tired in return. The Spaniards had apparently seen tl.e lights of the New York while tho latter was signalling to a ship of the squadron. The filing was reported by the officer on deck, Ensign J R Edie, to Capain Chadwick, w ho was asleep at the time. The young i fficer asked the Captain in somewhat excited tones whether the Now York had not bet discontinue signal IingHHHHIl tered Captain Chadwick, with the utmost coolness, “there is no necessity for stop ping the signals. Go ahead.”
A little later Captain Chadwick was on the forward bridge, from whence, he watched the tongues of flame shoot ou from Morro Castle. He glanced in the direction of the Spanish fortifications for a few sec.anda, and then turned his hack upon them and went hack to bed perfect |y certain that the Spanish could do no damage at five miles, which w as then the approximate distance of tho flagship from Morro Castle. There was no excitement board the flagship during Morro Cas. tie’s futile attempt at gunnery.
