A still more wonderful claim was made on the explorer, Cameron, nob far from the neighborhood of Gaboon. Some of the stranger's possessions proved unduly attractive to a native, and he determin'd on transferring the ownership to himself. He accordingly paid another native two hundred dol-, lars to procure for him the coveted 1 goods.
1 h® assistant t«Mik the money and did his best to earn it, hut Mr. Gamer-* on had inversely locked up the very articles that the fellow's employer hid set his heart upon^ The man could not carry out his bargain, and neither did he feel that he could part with the money. Therefore he ran off with it. What more logical than I hat the mnn who was the loser by 2 hundred dollars should expect the explorer to ma ko | the loss good f This he assuredly did expect.
Tie went to Mr. Cameron and told b in the story, demanding in the first place the two hundred dollars which he, Cameron, by locking up his goods, h id compelled the complainant to lose, and secondly the actual price of the goods t hemselves, which, but for these arbitrary measures, would now have t>een in his possession. It is not stated tbit his expectations were realised.
