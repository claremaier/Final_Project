Dresden, Deo. 12.—This town boasts a peculiarity of which its people may well be proud, am It prove# beyond dispute, that they possess that desirable Attribute, common sense, in no small degree. That peculiarity is the remarkable decrease in the numl>er of cases of Rheumatism during the last few yers.
Eight years ago, Dresden was afflicted by that curse of m< dern civilization. Rheumatism, to as great an extent, as any other place, of Its size in the I>>m-inion. To-day such a complaint is practically unknown here. '
A clue to the m ans by which this desirable condition his be*n , brought about any U) found in the following statement, given for publication by \v. G. Cragg, Esq., ex-reeve of the town, and one of our most prominent mâchants.
For eight years I was a martyr to Rheumatism, of t he Inflammatory type, and during that period, my suffering beggared description. To add to my misery I was attacked by Gout. Thu best doctors failed to benefit me, and no good was done by the many patent medicines I used.
"At times I could not get about at all, and at the best, It was a severe task for me to make my way alx>ut my store.	' i

Land which the Duke of Bedford pronounced as impossible to convert into really satisfactory pastures, except , perhips, at prohibitive cost, was partly treated with Alberts' Thomas-J’hosphute Powder, and Dr. F ream reporting on it last year concludes as follows:—"The portion of the field bordering on the road was occupied with exceedingly poor herbage, moss plentiful, and there was an abundance of hawk weed, both of which are indicative of poverty of the soil. The inner part of the field, where Thomas-Phosphate Powder hid been applied, had obviously benefited from tin dressing, t ha herbage was greener and fresher and had been more closely grazed. In addition there was a marked development of clover and other leguminous pi nts. Hvnc?, as a result of the dressing, it may In concluded that the condition of the oil was undergoing improvement, and that the gradual accumulation of nitrogen by the leguminous species will lead ultimately to the production of better I mnie valuable herbage."

The Chief Justice of England writes an excellent hand. It is heavy, angular, devoid of those flourishes which spoil so many handwritings, and has a slight slant to the right.
The Prince of Wales writes fairly well; a legible, rather heavy hand, with a slant to the right, and a freedom from flourish. On the whole, it is rather characteristic.
Lord Salisbury’s writing is — well, simply shocking. The Premier writes with a fine nib, lightly, thinly, and very badly, lie has a lofty disregard for thi formition of his letters "mV and "n's generally run along without any suggestion of getting up
