How often people are mistaken in their estimate of their fellow men! Here, f r
instance, is Hon. David Mills, who ha-been regarded as a great constitutional authority, ponderous in thought and weighty in speech—one who most fitting y adorns the Senate and presents to tin-very life one's conception of the 14 mov potent, grave and reverend seigno.-s, ” n!

FulAiled their pledges! Why, it was the richest joke of the season, and should have set the house in a roar. Nothing funnier has happened since Mr. Dobell sailed for Europa to secure a fast Atlantic service, nor more ludicr us since Mr.
Sifton was kalaoimned at Winnipeg by vffice holders and place- hunters.
1i must have struck Mr. Mills as something excruciatingly funny when, in msk ing this sidesplitting remark, he recalled the pledge to curtail the annual expend! ture by 840,000.000 and remembered that it had been increased by 83,000,000 in*

As to the remaining un represented constituency, that of West Huron in Ontario, the probabilities arc that the writ for a bve-elec»iou therein will be issu'd shortly, the delay being due to the ap pointaient of returning officers. The original intention of the government was to have all tho bye-elections brought off on thp same date.

He next proceeded to laud Mr MacLeod Stewart for the perseverence with which ho stuck to the scheme and showed how he had brought it to the point where the public contractors of the world, 8.

He showed how the distance from Duluth to Liverpool would be short ened by about 1,000 miles, which would great saving to the shipping of grain, etc. This route would be protected from great storms, which would lessen the rate of insurance to vessel owners and freighters. Mr. Poupore laid great stress on the many advantages that would accrue to the Ottawa Valley from the building of the canal, by reason of developing the many .mines in its midst, extension <-f pu p industry and many other ways. It the duty of every man in the Ottawa Valley to encourage the project. Mr. Poupore held that Mr. Liurier had not thrown cold water on the scheme and read the words used by the Premier in the House of Commons so that the audience could form their own opinions on the matter. Mr. Poupore then said in regard to the story that he was interested in getting the canal to go by the other aide of the Allumette Island, that it did
not matter to him which way the canal went, so long as it wont by way of the waters of the Ottawa. Mr. Poupore then concluued his speech by a strong appeal to the citizens of Pembroke to take an
interest in the scheme.
Mr. MacLeod Stewart then addressed the audience, and he tirst referred to his former visit to Pembroke on the same mission some five years ago and he then proceeded to give an historical sketch of the scheme, tie showed that the route chosen from the St. Lawrence to

Mr. XV h to pointed out the great ad van* t: ges which would accrue not only to the 0 tawa Valley but to the whole of the country by the construction of the canal. He concluded a strong speech in favor of «he scheme by eulogizing Mr. MacLeod Stewart for the great efforts he had put forth to launch the scheme, and doubted him the “ Merritt " of the Ottawa C*nal.
Mr. A Foster moved, seconded by Dr. Dickson that this meeting is of opinion that it would be in the interest of the Town of Pembroke that the construction of the Ottawa and Georgian Bay Canal should be proceeded with, and would re commend that the Town Council 'grant 8200 towards assisting the project.
Both the mover and seconder made able speeches in support of the motion, and the Mayor putting it to the meeting, Him worship declared it carried.
Votes of thanks were then passed to the speakers and chairman, when the meeting was brought to a conclusion.

Thousands of people were attracted by i he succession of the alarms and the glare of the burning building, and before the police stretched ropes aim »st blockaded Market, Eddy, Powell and Ellis streets.
For years the Baldwin has been regard by the tire department as the most danger ous fire trap in San Francisco. Built of wo >d, s x storeys high, with a narrow and tortuous hallway, it is a wonder that half of the pe >p!e in the hotel this morning escaped. They were slow to awaken.
Many were dazed and stupefied by smoke whon the police, the firemen, and hotel employees hurrying through the hallways, kicked open doors, and notified the people of their great danger. When they managed to reach the window $ and fire e$ capes there were no ladders. Many at tempted to jump from the windows to the street, but were warned not to do s . by the crowd below. Then the firemen got up their ladders and commenced taking people to the ground, rescuing many in this manner.

Then came the bringing of tho matter before the House of Commons by Mr. Poupore, and the appointment of a committee by the Senate and the giving of evidence before that committee of eminent engineers—engineers endorsing tho scheme, and Mr. Meldrum, the accredited agent of the great English firm, agreeing to build the canal and equip it when the Government would guarantee the two per cent, inter est on the estimated cost, 817,000,000. Mr. MacLeod Stewart showed the great advantage of sli pping by water, instead of by rail as to matter of cost, and claimed that in consequence the canal would be a paying investment.

Mr. Thomas Mackie, M. P., was the next speaker and made a few remarks ex preesive of his belief in the scheme. The only drawback was in setting the proper company to work it and if that was done and the Government assured of the feasibility of the scheme there would be no difficulty in getting the guarantee. Mr. Mackie paid a high tribute to Mr. Stewart's indefatigable energy in keeping the scheme before the people ank parliament.
Hon. P. White was the next speaker and he expressed hie faith in the scheme, and pointed out that it was not by any means a new one, ae it was spoken of forty years ago. The Government of that day had taken the matter up and surveys had been made of a portion of the route, but the project fell through.

Everyone is asking the motive of General Zurlimlvn in so persistently pursuing Colonel Piccjuart, and why a court-martial, if necessary, could not he post]foiled until the decision of the Court of Cassation has been given.

Freycinet, who is accused of quailing before General Zurlinden, and the General Staff.

Colonel Picquart continued his evidence before the Court of Cassation throughout the whole day, and his deposition is expected to occupy several days more. There is still some hope that he may receive justice, owing to the presence of the court-martial of Colonel Donnai, who

Chamborlaia to Settle French Shore
Question
St. John’s. NHL, Nov. 24 — The Colonial ministry today received by the English mad despatches from Right Hen. Joseph Chamberlain, secretary of state for the colonies, intimating that he had been furnished with the preliminary report of tho II »yal Commissioner who recently returned from tho colony, where they had been investigating the French Sohre question.
Mr. Chamberlain says tho condition of affairs represented by the commissioners was intolerable, and that he was preparing to open negotiations with Fiance for a settlement of the question so as to enable the colony to pursue its industries ui.hampered by the restrictions created by the existence of more or less substantial French rights.
Mr. Chamberlain bespoke the cordial peration of the colonial ministry and Legislature in any arrangement arrived at, promising to expedite the negotiations as much as possible.
Attempted Czar's -Life
Berlin, November. 23.—A despatch from E bing, the seaport of West Prussia, says an attempt was made upon the life of the Czar while His Majesty was returning from Copenhagen. Just before the Czar’s special train crossed the bridge between Doehmonhoefea and Lagern a switchman discovered that the bridge had been barricaded. By almost ruperhuinau efforts, as a result of which he is now in a hospital, the switchman, it appears, succeeded in removing the obstacles sufficiently to permit the passage of tho perial train.

may RAISE a GREATER STORM THAN DREYFUS AFFAIR
Paris, Nov. 25.—The Picquart case seems in the way of raising even a greater storm than the Dreyfus affair. The papers favorable to the general staff are dumb in the face of the barefaced deci-_1 „ of tho military governor of Paris,
General Zurlinden, to try Colonel Pic-quart by court martial, while those favoring revision are furious at this new attempt to defeat justice, and protest against the court martial being ordered.
Nobody believes that Picquart is guilty of any crime except a courageous desire to render justice to Dreyfus; but on all sides it is recognized that, in a practically secret trial, he may be condemned oil some technicality, thus attaining the apparent which is-to throw doubt upon his 1 depositions before the Court of Cassation , thousand worshippers
