Mr. Millar did not disclose the where •bouts of his deposit, but said it is so near the 0. P.

It should be explained, for the benefit of those not acquainted with the locality, that there is • waste tract of land of considerable ex tent in the section where the discovery is maid to have been made, which accounts for the mystery a# to the location. Mr. Williams brought samples of the coal home, and burned it partially together with other samples procured from dealers in town, ana no perceptible difference in the coals could be noticed after they ihad cooled. Mr. Millar asyshe does not intend to develop the mine until spring ; he has made several openings, and thinks It beet to let the matter rest for a month or two.—Observer.

Borrlbie Affray near Ottawa.
DOAN'S
Feb. 17.—Joseph Omier, a farmer, ng on the shore of the Ottawa, a ip!» of miles below Gatineau Point, lay all day yesterday at the point of death ult of an attempt by hie wife to kill him. The whole neighborhood is in o high pitch of excitement over the affair.
On Tuesday night about seven o'clock Omier was sitting at the table in the kitchen assisting hie seven year-old son to write a letter when hie wife suddenly seised an axe and struck him a heavy blow with it on the back of the neck.
He fell with a thud to the floor. The axe sunk deeply into the flash, and all but severed the spinal column, causing immediate paralysie of the whole although the unfortunate man remained conscious.
The little eon rushed out and gave the alarm to the neighbors, yelling excitedly that hia mother had killed hia father.
Mrs. Omier remained in the room.
Neighbors hurried into the house. Dr.
J. B. Laurin, of Gatineau Point, was summoned and reached there about twenty minutes after the blow was struck.
He saw that the spine was cut, and at once gave up hope of Omier recovering.
