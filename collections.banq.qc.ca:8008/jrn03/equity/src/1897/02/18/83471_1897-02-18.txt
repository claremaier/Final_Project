AZOV FROZEN OVER.
The first time in the remembrance of the living generation the Sea of Azov ie frozen over solid. The Don River and the sea of Azov froze very suddenly in a rather unexpected way, and, as a consequence, a number of vessels were taken unawares and stopped on their
way. More than 12 steamers are helpless in the ice between Azov and Rostov, and a large number of vessels are dispersed in various parts of this immense frozen sheet of water, first tossed about by the violent storm and then held hi the first glacial embrace. While the River Don has frequently frozen over there is no record of the Sea of Azov having frozen solid in this century.	• »	'

THE LEADING HOUSE.
v ° January with us is a Stock Reducing Month. °<3

There is a difference in the new way of doing business ; the theory was that certain months in the year must necessarily be dull—no use in trying
to make them otherwise. But this store has changed the complexion of business and has shown that there is no need for dull days at any time
when the wants of the shopping public are given thoughtful consideration.
January will be one of the busy months of the year notwithstanding business tradition which says that things flatten out after the holidays January is known for sales of unusual interest in all departments with us. Profits are sacrificed, and quick clearance our chief object,

The telephone has now been adopted in London ad permanent adjunct to the pulpit. St. Michael's Church, Chester Square, is the last to be supplied with a telephone equipment, with the approbation of Canon Fleming, who preaches there.
Wires run directly from the pulpit to the hospital nearby, where the bidrid-den may listen to the sermon as vs ell as though they were in pews in the church itself. In addition to this, private subscribers may be supplied with the full sermon and church service right in their own homes if they only choose to pay the regular tolls.

The most destructive fire that has ever occurred in the Ottawa Parliament Buildings began about 4 o'clock on Thursday afternoon and continued throughout the entire night despite all thst could be done to arrest its progress. As a result the front part and east wing of what ia known as the Western Block has been entirely despoiled of its magnificent roof and top storey, the ruined portion extending over an area of about 600 feet in length. The new wing, containing the Mackensie tower, built about 20 year» ago, escaped the flames, thanks to the existence of a fire proof wall, which divided the old
from the new part of the huge structure.	____
