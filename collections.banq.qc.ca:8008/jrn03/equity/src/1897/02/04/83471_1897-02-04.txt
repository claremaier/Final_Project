The board of directors of Agricultural Society, No. 1, held a meeting here on Saturday at which the proposed extension of the Society’s grounds formed the chief matter for consideration. Since the additional piece of land in rear of the old grounds has been secured from Mr. -las.
L. Shaw, it ham become evident to most of the directors, that a very appreciable improvement could bd made in the shape of the grounds, by acquiring a still further strip of land along the west aide of the plot, thus increasing it in width, and at the same making it more proportionate.
To accomplish this without placing much of an additional burden on the society, it is suggested that a row of village lots be sold off the front part of the grounds, or exchanged with Mr. Shaw, in lieu of the additional strip of land required for wid e n in g them. The idea seems to be a very

The Ottawa Citizen of Wednesday last springs some additional news about ti e recent fatal wreck on the O. A. & P.' S. It seems that at the inquest on the death of William Russell the jury were not satisfied to render a verdict on the evidence and adjourned the inquest until February 3rd. The opinion gains ground that the switch was opened maliciously. It ia further stated that Detective Mat-ton left the city on Tuesday night for Barry's Bay to arrest Peter Clement and Charles Golgoleen, the latter a Pole, in connection with the accident. They were engaged in a lumber shanty Berry,s Bay and it is said there is evidence to show that they were seen at the siding a short time before the accident.

Rumor has it that Mr. Smith is not very deeply impressed with Sir Henry Joly’s fitness as a representative of Her Majesty's Government (perhaps for the same reason that Dr (rib oury is not very enthusiastic over Mr. Tarte). If a certain public official does not receive hie congé, Mr. Smith will hkely be more impressed with Sir Henry's unfitness.

1 here is a difference in the new way of doing business ; the theory was that certain months in the year must necessarily be dull—no use in trying to make them otherwise. Hut this store has changed the complexion of business and has shown that there is no need for dull days at ayy time when the wants of the shopping public are given thoughtful consideration.	/	^ . '
January will be one ot the busy months of the year notwithstanding business tradition which says that things flatten out after the holidays. January is known for sales of unusual interest in all departments with us. Profits are sacrificed, and quick clearance our chief object.

London, January 29 —In the House of C'trimons to-day, in reply to a question by Sir George Baden-Powell, Mr. Chamberlain said that the Government, wiih the approval of Her Majesty had in-filed the prime ministers of the several Colonies to come to England and take part in the celebration of the completion of the sixty years of the Queen’s reign.
If the invitations were ao r. Chamberlain continued, the Premiers would be the guests of Great B'itsin. (Cheers ) Replies to the in vnationa he added, had already been ie ceived from the premiers of Canada and the other North American colonies, the Cape Colony and Natal, all of which were extremely gratifying.
The D un inion Government must pass an alien labor taw.” So said Mr. Stanley Henderson, of Vancouver, B. C.t to » Journal reporter in Ottawa a few days •go. Mr. Henderson said several American mine owners and contractors in the Rloean and other mfiling centres of British Columbia who had ah aolutely . refused to employ Canadian • wmkmen in mining and in the building of tram-roads and other transportation lines he stated that if Canada did i at once it would be useless for her to act at all, because there were ao many American employees and employers representing such a large amount ofi capital, that attempt to deport the workmen and enforce an alien labor law would undoubt edly cause international complications to arise.

There was a meeting of the Cabinet Council on Saturday last, at which the date of the meeting of the Dominion Parliament was fixed for Thursday, March 11.
The date is exactly one month later than was anticipated when Parliament was prorogued on 5th October last, it being then pretty well understood that Parliagg ¦ ¦ ment would be called for February 11th. [ North Onslow
Mr, Laurier then anticipated time than he has experienced with the] Calumet Island school question, and Sir Richard wrm more assured then than he is now that the people of Canada wanted ‘Hhi last vestiges of protect on swept away, but the “sunny ways of peace" still remain overcast, and the Tariff Commission IMM far as ever from finding any dtspon amongst either the producers or the Burners in Canada toward the “free trade as it is in England/' about which Mr,
Laurier used to wax so eloquent when in Opposition, but about which we have not
heard so much lately.
