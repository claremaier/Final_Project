Dear bir,—The whines of certain indi»
fiducie, which ere tiudtug vent the., times through the Advance, because the protest against Mr. Puupors has been disposed of without their knowledge or counsel, are indeed pitiful in the ext reroe. It would seem to me that in the dispene at ion of the alleged “boodle”- which Mr. E.T. Martin asserts played so important a part in corrupting the electors of this township, he and others who are tempting to raise a dust, must have been overlooked. Ten chances to one they had a lively hope of getting their paws well greased, and because of their disappointment in this regard, are now pre tending that their feeling# have been previously outraged by the course ev nts have tak-n.

It was down to 20 below z« ro for one night, but the average of the winter, I think, would be about 16 degrees of frost ; and in the •ix winters I have been in the Valley, I have not seen a drift as large as that which would gather in one hours storm about Shawville. I have not seen any pitch holes either. The snow is about two feet deep, but will soon he leaving, as sleigh ing always breaks up early in March -sometimes in February.

There is also a Urge aaw mill being built and will soon be ready to supply lumber for all who quire it, and a bnck yard close by where yon can get first class brick, either press ed or wire cut ; also drsin tile from three tip to eleven inch. Enderby has th churches and a public school ; and here, let me say, the school system is hard to beat. The Government builds the school house, pays the teacher, sud gives forty dollars per year to keep up the echool,and wherever there are enough children of the right age to have a school, (twelve, I think,) they will do the rest. There is no school fee or school tax, only a tax of three dollars on every man from eighteen to sixty years of age.
The mountains on either side the Valley are rich in gold and silver, and it will not he long till we have mines working and paying well, too.
I see hy H. Morrisson's letter that he is much taken up with mining, and thinks it would be well for some of the I 8hawville boy# to come out and try it too.
But here let me may that it is well to “look before you leap.” If one man came from the east and “struck it rich,”
it is no proof that all will do the same. People are amazed to see the tea that Many a man has spent all his money pros- McGuire is offering for 20 cents Ducting and never got a cent in return.

Oar representative interviewed Mr. James Brayley, of Hamilton, at his office, 68 King I William Street. Mr Brayley ia an enterprising business man, and one of Hamilton's foremost manufacturers. His goods, Saddlery hardware, punches, dies, etc, are known from Halifax to Vancouver, and stand very high in the estimation of the trade.
Mr. Brayley said : “ For years I have been troubled with gravel and weakness of the kidneys. I had to stand up and clench my teeth I when urinating, so intense was the pain. The pains around my loins where almost intolerable, and I felt as though a cat were being pulled down my back by the hind legs.
"I went from bad to worse till at last I could not urinate at all, and had to be operated on.
I had no confidence in anything, and made np my mind to suffer torture to my dying day. Reading the testimony published by the Doan Kidney Pills Co., I saw a similar case to my own, and, being in constant agony, decided to give them a trial, and got a box of the pills from Bpackman's drug store, at the corner of Market Square.
“ It did me no good, so I got another, and another, until I had taken four boxes, and was about giving up when relief came. I continued to take them till the pain left my back, and I am now as limber as an eel. Instead of getting up a dozen times a night I never get up more than once now. The urine is now perfectly clear and has no sediment of any kind.
