? Pontiac Pioneer Paseee Away,
Fall of Tears.
N
On the 30th of March last there passed over to tho silent majority one of the oldest pioneers of the Calumet Island, in the person of the late James Cahill, than whom no more highly respected and es teemed man could bo found in Pontiac.
The subject of this sketch was one of the pioneer lumbermen of the Ottawa, who, in partnership with hie late brother Horatio, got out square timber in the early titties and for several years thereafter, on Black River. Hie business relations with the inhabitants of the county of Pontiac were far reaching and no farmer or workman had anything to say of the late James Cahill and hie brother, but what was of the most kind and flattering character.
The place vacated by the death of the late James Cahill will not be filled in Pontiac for a long time, and although he had reached the mature age of 82 years still he will be in.seed and regretted by all who had the advantage of personal acquaintance with him.
Being of a genial and sympathetic character, and always ready to extend the hand of good fellowship to his friends— and they are all those whose acquaintance he had formed—it will be a long, longtime before another Janies Cahill will appear upon this mundane sphere who will be respected and loved by his friends as this late lamented gentleman was.
If the good will of the community and the kind and benevolent character of the deceased should account for his happiness in the great eternity into . which he has ushered, then the late James Cahill
