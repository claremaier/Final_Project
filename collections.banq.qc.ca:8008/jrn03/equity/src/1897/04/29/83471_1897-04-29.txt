The doctors said I could not live three months, but thanks to Dr. Allen's “Pearly Pebbles'* I am now fully recovered ; and when I see a sick friend I always tell him to take “Pearly Pebbles’1 because they saved my life. I know they did. Suffering friends, try them. It only took six boxes to cure me. Yours Truly,

He did not think that because certain gentlemen In the city of Ottawa had constituted themselves a company to build a street railway in that city they had any right to prevent any other rail way from the outside having entrance to the city. The question was whether the Ottawa Electric Railway controlled the capital. If it did not, then the Hull Electric Railway ought to be allowed to enter the city.

The Hull Electric Railway bill was taken up at a meeting of the railway committee of the House of Commons last Wednesday morning.
Mr. Poupore, M. P. fpr this county, had charge of the bill. He explained its provisions, which, he s nid, were in effect to permit the lease of the Hull branch of the Canadian Pacific railway to the Hull Electric Rail way, for a period of 35 years, and also to allow the Hull Electric Railway company to bring passengers of the I o Pontiac Pacific Junction from Aylmer I U16 over the Hull Electric Railway into the city of Ottawa. It had been alleged this was » scheme against the Ottawa Electric Railway. It was nothing of the kind. All that was wanted was to reach the city of Ottawa and leave their passengers in the city at the different depots.
If they could not get to all the depots they would like to get as far into the city as they could. They had a right to get over the Chaudière bridge, that being a public work, and what they wanted was to reach the railway depots by getting running privileges or otherwise over the
