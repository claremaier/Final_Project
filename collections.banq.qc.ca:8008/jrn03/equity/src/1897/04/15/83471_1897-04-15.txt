The main idea which our cotem trieeXimpress upon his readen’ minds is, that ovenhadowing all other alleged defects, the Flynn Government has been both extravagant and incompetent. Now, then let us see how f it this statement is justified by c unparing Mr. Flynn’s record with that of the Mer-adminiatration. There is nothing fatuous nor assumptive about this; the fig-are from the Public Accounts of the Province, and are incontrovertible :
In 1891 a Liberal Government spent #281,078 on legislation ; in 1896 a Conservative Government got along by spending
only #195.549.
In 1891 a Liberal Government spent #269,660 on civil administration ; in 1896 a Conservative government got along with

The disastrous effect which the conduct

The North Hastings Review says The Toronto Tudor Gold Mining Company sold the Craig mine, near Bannockburn, to the company represented by J. D. Edgar, Oronhyatekhs, and other capitalists for the sum of $47,000. This is a mine that was purchased a few weeks ago from Peter Vankleek, James Maitland and others for $12,000. The new owners take possession of the Craig this week. Without a doubt there is wealth in the Madoc district gold mines.

The popularity of our suits
Canada and the Behring Seau.
A very large delegation from the Georgian Bay District waited on the Government last week, with reference to the pulp wood and saw log trade. The delegation asked that "in the event of any foreign country imposing an export duty of more than $1 per thousand on white pine lumber imported from Canada and entering such country then the port of white pine saw logs or pulp wood timber of any kind be absolutely prohibited from Canada and that duties be imposed upon lumber entering Canada from any country which imposes duties against Canadian lumber, at the same rates us charged by such foreign country."

We are forced to conclude, relying upon our correspondent, that a strong bitter feeling exists in America against Canada, and Mr. Foster, who is an expert in the art, is using the press to create an agitation.

ELECTRICITY TO PRESERVE EGGS.
A New York electrician has discovered a method for preserving egg» in edible condition for a number of years. The only successful method now is to soak the eggs in lime water, which
closes up the pores of the shell and kills any germs which may be attached to them. Under the most favourable conditions, however, this method will not prmerve an egg for more than three months. The new method is much more complicated. It is well known that an egg shell is more or less porous, and that air passes into the egg and hastens its decay. In preserving eggs by the new method the egg is first placed in a vacuum chamber which draws the air from the interior. The eggs are then painted with a composition which renders them airtight. After this they will be placed in barrels of water and subjected to an electric current strong enough to destroy any germ life which may be present.

He said that his scheme of redress provided that upon maturity of the note and the fail-of the maker to meet the prescribed payments, the holder of the paper could collect no more than the legal rate of in terest, 6 per cent. But he had arranged that both parties to the transaction should be protected. The lender was to take his interest in the share of discount ; that is to say, he must deduct his inter est from the amount demanded on the face
the maturity of the note should the borrower fail to discharge hie obligation the lender could collect interest at the legal rate only.
On the motion for the second reading of the bill to abolish the Superannuation Act, the Government and the Opposition had a pretty lively passage at arme, fol lowing the objection of Mr. Lariviere that the bill was not printed in French in compliance with the rules of the House, which eet forth that the bill must be so printed before it can receive its second reading. The government endeavored to have the objection waived, in order to proceed with the bill, but they were told by the Opposition to go business before the House than do this the Government decided to adjourn the House.
