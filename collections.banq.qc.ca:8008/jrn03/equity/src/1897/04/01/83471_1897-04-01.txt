Pedlar Robbed.—A subscriber has handed us the following, which relates the experience of a pedlar while travel-jg through the township of Lowe :
The pedlar, it seems, took a short-cut to his destination by way of a saw log road, and while travelling thereon, he fell in with two men engaged in hauling logs. The toqn ordered him to open his pack and show hie goods, which he refused to do. They then compelled him to open up, and proceeded to help themselves to part of tne contents of the pack. They not satisfied with this act of brig •ndage, but attempted to relieve the pedlar of his money. Luckily, at this juncture, another man appeared on the scene, whereupon the two would be highwaymen took to their heels. The pedlar secured the names of his sailante, and intends making it uncom fortably hot for them.

The Directors, realizing that the rate of interest obtainable on good investments may be considered as permanently lowered, gave careful considers tion to the rate of interest to be employed in cirrfilating the policy and annuity obligat ions of the Assocaat ion, and as a result decided to use a rate of 81-2 per cent, for aU the business written subsequent (to December 31,1895, instead of 4 1-2. as formerly. This
have the effect of strengthening
the position of the company* and affording greater security to its policyholders.
The Directors are pleased to call attention to the fact that the head office building is gradually filling up, and that there is every prospect that in the near future* with a revival# m business, it will be fully occupied. In the meantime, in view of the incorrect impression occasionally sought to be made, we are not saying too much when we state that the building is paying fully as well as any similar building in Canada.
The Directors have had under consideration the question of going outside of Canada for business, and. while it has not been definitely decided, it is quite probable that, subject to the ap uroval of this meeting, the right to do business in some parts Of the United States of America may be sought for at an eaady dais
The Directors are also pleased to report that the field and office at a f fa continue to discharge their duties with efficiency and faithfulness.

From the Rowland “Miner” of March 2nd, we clip the following ;
Kaslo, March 1.-(Special)-An portant mining deal has been c roiummat ed in this city. P. J. Naeh ham purchae ed a one half interest in the mineral claims First Chance, R. E. Adame, Galt and Hillside. These claims are situated in the Jackson Basin, about three quarters of a mile from the Whitewater station of the Raealo & Slocum railway. J. Fred Ritchie, of Roesland, is interested with Mr. Nash in the new deal. Sufficient funds have been placed in a bank to the credit of the trustees to work the property for three months and the work now in progress will be continued without interruption. There are at present on the claims several tons of galena ore taken from an open cut. The tunnel will now be driven with two shifts of workmen. E. Ward, foreman of the Whitewater mine, and Charles Behrraan, of this city, are also interested in this property. It would seem from the outlook at these claims that another shipper will be added to the SU can list an at early day. Articles of agreement for corporation are now be ing prepared. The company will be known as the Hillside Mining Company and organized under the laws of British Columbia. ”
The gentleman mentioned above are Mr P (» Nash, formerly clerk of the U. O D. Assn , and his brother in-law, Mr. Fred Ritchie, brother of Mr.R.McC. Ritchie, of Bryson.
