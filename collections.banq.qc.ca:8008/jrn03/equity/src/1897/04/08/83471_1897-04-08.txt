pain, that Mr. David < üllivs be again I chosen as the Liberal standard bearer in | the coming election. In speaking to hie 4 007 motion, Mr. Smith said that while ho un- j 1 CSSz Z * derstood Mr. Oilliee would run as an independent Liberal, he felt assured be (frillies) would accord Mr. Marchand a faithful support and would do no injustice to the Liberal party. If he were not convinced of this he (Smith) would be the last man to support him. The motion carried.
Mr. frillies then formally accepted the nomination, remarking that it was the second time he had sought the suffrages of the people of Pontiac, and he hoped to he treated as handsomely as on the last occasion. He intended running as an Independent Liberal, and would strive to do his duty as a man and a citizen. (A voice—Hotter come out straight, Mr.
Gillies). Hut Mr. G. thought differently and that he could best servo the people's interests if him hands were not tied. He felt grateful for the nomination and hoped he would he returned.
It was then announced that the mayor and council of Shawville were going to present Mr. Marchand with an address ut the Pontiac House, and of course every one vacated the hall am quickly as possible to witness this unique and rather uuex peeled feature of the proceedings. The address was drafted by Messrs. S. A. Me Kay and D. R. Harry, and read and presented to Mr. Marchand on the gullet y of the Pontiac House by Secretary .1. R.
Horner. It was couched in the following language :

The mooting held hero on Wednesday last by tho Liberals of the county for the purpose of selecting a candidate for the local Legislature, was fairly well attended although it could not be strickly called a representative one, as the contingent from and including Calumet Island westward was decidedly small. Among tho crowd which comfortably tilled Hudgins' Hall in the afternoon,—when the moving spirits of the Liberal machine had got matters down to workable shape,— could easily he distinguished the physiogs of a goodly number of old Conservative veterans, who doubtless came to hear what the “other fellows” had to say about them, and perhaps in expectation of witnessing a repetition of the grotesque scenes which made memorable the Liberal convention <»f a year ago, when the difficulty of find ing a victim for the sacrifice was so apparent.
This time, however, the “management” decided to conduct matters on a different system, making sure to have everything “cut and dry” before tho business of the meeting was entered into. In other words a caucus of the Liberal leaders was held in the morning, and an understanding arrived at by which no opposition was to be offered to the candidature of Mr. Gillies.

unwarrantably extravagant ; that they had not only carried cut the notorious Valliero and Charlebois contracts (entered into during Mercier’s time) but had given those parties additional work at the same figures. He also tried to make it appear that the Mercier administration had only increased the floating debt of the province by the sum of five million dollars, and about four millions of this amount was, he said, a legacy from their predecessors in office.
These are sample illustrations of the kind of clap trap which Mr. Stephens pawned off on his hearers as matters of fact, he imagining, no doubt, that away in the backwoods of Pontiac people would swallow it all as gospel.
A vote of thanks to the speakers and cheers for Messrs. Marchandé and Gillies’ success terminated the proceedings.
