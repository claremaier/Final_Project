We operate our store on a determined policy of fair, souare dealing, backed by resources and ability. This means that we give the customer the benefit of the lowest prices every time. We do not slaughter our goods nor sacrifice any special line to bolster up any others, but purchase carefully, buy closely, and sell on a narrow margin of profit. We have grown a repu ta* tion for reasonable prices that we intend shall stay with us, and this principle is in operation in every department and on every article in our store. It paya you to trade here because you get what you like and what you need. It paya you to trade here because there is fixed, honest system of value. Before you buy—investigate. Our

one state, Hesjukovsohts, China, which
is governed entireJy by women, and the
men are "not in it," so to speak. The I on
idea originated In 18(11, when a famine
followed an epidemic; the women bs-
oaiae aroused en masse, ordered the men
to seek large cities and search for work, the men returning only for the holidays. The women transact all of the business, levy the taxes, till the soil, pay the shepherd, &o. All of the work is lyeternalized, and, after the busy day every one assembles in the church square to hear reporta of common interest. The Mayor of each town of the state presides and makes a abort address each evening, when public questions are discussed in the most buai-lUce manner. The latest statistics show, however, that the average age of the women is leas than in the days of serfdom.

At 2.80
o'clock in the afternoon while King Humbert was on hi* way to the races, a man named Pietro Acciarito, an iron worker out of employment, attempted to at ah his Majesty with a dagger. The man was seized lx*fore he could carry out his purpose and the King proceeded to the Campa nid le race course seemingly unmoved. On arriving at the race course his Majesty we* greatly cheered. Acciarito appears to be s political fanatic. He says he has no accomr pi ices.
King Humbert, accompanied by him
aide-de-camp, Gen. Pondis Vaglia, warn
going to witness the royal Derby. His
aeaailant, waiting outside St. John's
gate, rushed up to the carriage in
which hie majesty was seated and att cm ; «4L ed to stab him. The King avoided the danger by rising from his seat. Acciarito, seeing he had failed in his attempt to assassinate the King, threw away his dagger and was immediately arrested by two carbineers, while his Majesty calmly ordered his coachman to drive on. The news spread with great rapidity, and when the King reached the royal stand at the race course it was soon surrounded by a cheering multitude. The members of diplomatic corps present at the and a number of other distinguished people sent their congratulations to the King on his escape. King Humbert treated the matter lightly and remarked, "It im only one of the little adventures of my trade." The King remained at the race course with his nephew, the Hike of Aota, until the royal Derby was run. Acciarito is 24 yearn old and a native of Artegna, a village of Italy, province of Udine.
