The namee of tt * div^ era are Briggs and May they were subject to a pressure of vent y \o seventy-five pounds to the square inch, causing them great suffering. The GabterthU-n was wrecked in August, 189b. while on the voyage from Sydney to Hong Kong. Fifty-four of her crew and paweegers lost their lives, including brave Capt. Shannon. The vessel's eaigo consisted of prethlw» and £10,000 in sovereigns. J ~M

A blow to the canned salmon industry has been dealt by the reimpoaition of the duty of half a cent a pound on fresh aalmon. That duty warn removed two years ago by the Government, the United States duty on Freah salmon having also been removed. It proved beneficial to the canning industry, which was enabled to keep running more steadily, and put up a larger pack in the season. Now, when the canneries had become adjusted to the change, fresh salmon is taxed again. The Victoria Colonist say the tendency of the duty is to drive some of the large cannera out of the province.

Expresses. Road Carts. Buggies.
To some observers of the situation, the defeat of the Flynn Government does not so much mean a preference for Mr. Marchand as it does a strengthening of the hands of Hon. Mr. Laurier, whose name figured a great deal more conspicuously during the campaign than did that of the local leader. There is no questioning the fact that French Quebec at present is infatuated with the name 44 Laurier ”, and when it was represented that a vote for Marchand meant also a vote for Lsuner, the appeal became as invincible as it did in June last, when the French Canadian chieftain won the sympathies of his com» patriots with amazing success.
Mr. Flynn, although defeated has no occision to reproach himself with havjpg failed in his duty to the province. He warn a most indefatigable worker, in fur-
may be favored in a most satisfactory manner.
A whole car-load of Buggies, Road Carts, Express Wagons, just received, which you are invited to inspect.
