On this particular night I put on my bat with the intention of going out to take a quiet walk, but just as I got to the door I saw lying on a step a pamphlet.

Mr. Gillies may not have been consulted very much about public matters during his first term at Quebec, because it was well known he had not the patronage of jVLrirKflfc the government. But things have changed very much in his favor in that regard, for not only ham he control of the patron age now, but he represents the interests of Conservatives as well as Liberals at Quebec, and we take him to be a man who will see that no injustice is done to either. Acting on this ground it does not seem necessary that he should require anybody to champion him ; nevertheless he will not be free from the assaults of craven individuals such as ìQuio" unless he accorda them the full measure of their hungry demands. That Mr. Gillies is not willing to become the dishonorable agent of an unreasonable gang seems prÍt* ty clear from the estimate placed upon him by ìQuio", in his winding up sen-

Cut throating is not the occupation Mr. Gillies was expect ed to fulfil when the people of Pontiac placed their mandate in his hands, and we fancy it is a work of political supererogation with which he will have nothing to It is evident this view is also heíd

The total yield of wheat is placed at 673.700,000 metric hundredweight, while the present annual requirements are estimated at 666,150, metric hundredweight. It is calculated that for 1807 and 1898 there will be a shortage of 60,800.000 hundredweight. The stocks remaining on hand from 1896 are approximately estimated at somewhere between 38,000,000 and 45,000,000. The total supply for the year, reckoning both the present sto< k.-ª and hhm harvest, is estimated at from 610,000.000 to 651,000,000 metric hundredweight.
The world's deficits are estimated as follows:óRye, 193.200.000 bushels; I ar-ley, 106,400,000; oats, 162.400.0,0; corn. 165,200,000. The report states that many reporting countiies, such as

He swore that he was telling the truth, and said that his wife was one of the most abominable women in the world. District Attorney Oloott got the man to make a sworn statement in writing. The statement was prepared on Wednesday, and was signed by Nack on Thursday night. He was at the office of the District Attorney on Wednesday giving assistance in the preparation of the statement.

The yield of wheat in Great Britain this season is fifty million of bushels against 63,000,000 bushels last year.

The authorities have sanctioned the immediate concentration of two brigades under Col. Elles at Shabkadr to advance as a punitive force direct into the Mohmand country, and check an expected second raid of Haddah Mullah, with 4,000 tribesmen. This decision has given great satisfaction, and the knowledge that the British forces have at last tak the offensive will probably have a datËrent effect on the tribes all along the frontier. General Blood will operate with Col. Elles in this expedition.

THE SULTAN'S INFLUENCE NIL.
The Constantinople correspondent of The Daily Telegraph says that after careful inquiries he is convinced that the Sultan's iwreonal influence among the Mussulmans in northwest India is ´existent. There is no doubt, the correspondent says, that the suggestion that the Sultan instigated the trouble is flattering to his vanity, but it is quite clear that nothing can restore to the Sultan his preponderance in the Mussulman world.

Eighteen*-y ear-old Morris Grogan is in the Long Island College Hospitalª Brooklyn, N.Y., with a broken neck, and the indications are that he has a good chance of recovery, notwithstanding the fact that two-thirds of his body is paralyzed.
Two weeks ago, Grogan was in bathing. From a height of twelve feet he
dived into four feet of water, striking on his head. He was taken out unconscious. When the ambulance arrived he had regained his senses, but b-st them again on the way to the hospital. An examina ton showed that the third cervical vertebra was broken. This is an injury which nearly always proves fatal.
