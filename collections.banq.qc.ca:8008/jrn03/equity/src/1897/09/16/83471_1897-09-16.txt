of Sisera, the warrior; of Father, who overcame royalty; of Abigail, who stopped a host by her own beautiful prowess; of Mary, who nursed the world's Saviour; of Grandmother Jams, immortalized in her grandson Timothy; of Charlotte Corday. who drove the dagger through the heart of the assassin of her lover, or of Marie Antoinette who by one look from the balcony of her castle quieted a mob, her own scaffold the throne of forgiveness and w omanly courage.

When at last we come to calculate the forces that decided the destiny of nations, it will lie found that the mightiest and grandest influence came from home, where the wife cheered up despondency and fatigue and sorrow by her own sympathy, and the mother trained her child for heaven, starting the little feet on the path to the celestial city, and the sisters by their gentleness reiuied the man mi s of the brother, and the daughters were diligent in their kindness to the aged, throwing wreaths 01 blessing on the road that leads father and mother down the steep of years.

Mr. Gillies may not have been consulted very much about public matters during his first term at Quebec, because it was well known he had not the patronage of jVLrirKflfc the government. But things have changed very much in his favor in that regard, for not only ham he control of the patron age now, but he represents the interests of Conservatives as well as Liberals at Quebec, and we take him to be a man who will see that no injustice is done to either. Acting on this ground it does not seem necessary that he should require anybody to champion him ; nevertheless he will not be free from the assaults of craven individuals such as “Quio" unless he accorda them the full measure of their hungry demands. That Mr. Gillies is not willing to become the dishonorable agent of an unreasonable gang seems prêt* ty clear from the estimate placed upon him by “Quio", in his winding up sen-

The total yield of wheat is placed at 673.700,000 metric hundredweight, while the present annual requirements are estimated at 666,150, metric hundredweight. It is calculated that for 1807 and 1898 there will be a shortage of 60,800.000 hundredweight. The stocks remaining on hand from 1896 are approximately estimated at somewhere between 38,000,000 and 45,000,000. The total supply for the year, reckoning both the present sto< k.-» and hhm harvest, is estimated at from 610,000.000 to 651,000,000 metric hundredweight.
The world's deficits are estimated as follows:—Rye, 193.200.000 bushels; I ar-ley, 106,400,000; oats, 162.400.0,0; corn. 165,200,000. The report states that many reporting countiies, such as

He swore that he was telling the truth, and said that his wife was one of the most abominable women in the world. District Attorney Oloott got the man to make a sworn statement in writing. The statement was prepared on Wednesday, and was signed by Nack on Thursday night. He was at the office of the District Attorney on Wednesday giving assistance in the preparation of the statement. In the beginning of the statement Herman Nack states that he oame to New York from Germany in ¦His wife arrived here a few month» before he didHHpHHH that her maiden name is Augusta Pus-ait, and that she was born in Lonway-on-Klbe, in Germany.

The yield of wheat in Great Britain this season is fifty million of bushels against 63,000,000 bushels last year.

The authorities have sanctioned the immediate concentration of two brigades under Col. Elles at Shabkadr to advance as a punitive force direct into the Mohmand country, and check an expected second raid of Haddah Mullah, with 4,000 tribesmen. This decision has given great satisfaction, and the knowledge that the British forces have at last tak the offensive will probably have a datèrent effect on the tribes all along the frontier. General Blood will operate with Col. Elles in this expedition.
It is reported that a punitive expedition, consisting of 20,000 men, will shortly lie sent into the Afridis* country, with orders to push on to Tirah.
THE SULTAN'S INFLUENCE NIL.
The Constantinople correspondent of The Daily Telegraph says that after careful inquiries he is convinced that the Sultan's iwreonal influence among the Mussulmans in northwest India is «existent. There is no doubt, the correspondent says, that the suggestion that the Sultan instigated the trouble is flattering to his vanity, but it is quite clear that nothing can restore to the Sultan his preponderance in the Mussulman world.

Eighteen*-y ear-old Morris Grogan is in the Long Island College Hospital» Brooklyn, N.Y., with a broken neck, and the indications are that he has a good chance of recovery, notwithstanding the fact that two-thirds of his body is paralyzed.
Two weeks ago, Grogan was in bathing. From a height of twelve feet he
dived into four feet of water, striking on his head. He was taken out unconscious. When the ambulance arrived he had regained his senses, but b-st them again on the way to the hospital.
