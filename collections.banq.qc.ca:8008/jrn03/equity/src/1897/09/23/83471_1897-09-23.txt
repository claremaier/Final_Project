There ia a very simple method of curing V>oth hy drophobia and that form of epilepsy which la so frequently mistaken for it, which cure ia known aa the Buisson treatment, and is effected by forcing the poison through the pores of l lie skin by profuse perspiration. In cafc«H where convulsions have already
taken place, the patient should enter |ipor hath, with temperature from 127 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and remain there until all symptoms ef hydrophobia have disappeared. Where these baths are used as a preventive, one should be taken on each of seven consecutive days.
