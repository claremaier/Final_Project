dent would never have ed.” Such is a jwiraphrasc* and a condensation of J>ong «lake's conception of his duty, arrived at after hours of slow laborious thought. The logic of the conclusion was more than quest ionaule ; and as for the prompting that led to it, Jake was simply self-deceived. Even supposing any good sprang up from the unburdening of spirit, it would lie reaped by the wrong person ; a load would be lifted from l/mg Jake’s heart, not a pennyweight's from Mrs. Truacott's. Yet, as lie reined up at the store, Long Jake honestly believed that he about $to do tlie next l>est tiling to reparation, which wa< inipotisible.

Yet a moment later the plunge was made—a veritable flounder to incoherence. Then, coming up—so to speak— for breath, a series of verbal splashes followed, tremulous with rough pent up emotion ; for some seconds the words cha>»d each other tumultuously from his hoarse throat, then ceased. And the widow knew all that had been on the poor fellow’s mind for months j
How did she hear it ? Silently, at fir-t; then with a flight catch of the breath: then with quiet tears. And when all was said, she h ant forward on her low chair and pronounced, not forgiveness, but words of thanks.

He dropped it quickly, drew a deop sigh half of relief, half of liewild-erment, wiped his shirt sleeve across his brow, and without a word, stepped from the veranda.
Mrs. Truscott called him bark He must stay a little while, she said kindly, and talk to lier; she never talked to any one, you see Jake sal down humbly ; he would have done anything she told him, just then ; but what could he talk about ? Silence. Jake shifted nervously. Some subtle instinct whispered that he would be evermore disgraced if he left the lady to begin the conversation. So he stumbled into this, '* I’m goin* to cîekr out o’ this soon '

The Central Canada Exhibition which closed on Saturday last, was the most successful from a financial [ of any yet held, although the attendance was below that of last year. The receipts for the week were $22,%3 as against $21, 598 for last year. The gate receipts were $300 less than last year, but the difference was made up by the largely increased receipts of the grand stand at the evening performances, which were largely patronized. The exhibition as a whole fully up to last year’s, the falling off noticable in some exhibits, being amply made up in other respects.
A good deal of dissatisfaction was expressed because the night performances could only be seen from the grand stand. A large number expressed the opinion that this made the fair partake too much of a grab game, and that in the end it would prove more of a disadvantage than a benefit to the Association. The thing undoubtedly a mistake, and we think the directors will act wisely if they omit making it next year.

SttSBjptto fact these suspicions were grounded upon Simpson's own words, who declared with in the hearing of several that he oould not live since his wife was gone. It appears, however, that be managed to elude the vigilance of those who un dertook to watch him, and getting hold of a parcel of Paris green that was in the house, swallowed a large dose of the fatal drug. To make the iob doubly sure, he then suspended himself with the strap as already stated, and when found shortly afterwards by his brother, he was beyond the power of recovery.
The deceased was married about ten months ago to the widow of the late Albert Meyers, with whom he lived very happily. Mrs. Simpson gave birth to twin daughters about ten days ago, and from the effects of this illness she died
on Sunday morning, daughter of Mr. Burke, of Thorne.
The deceased James Simpson was only about 28 years of age, and previous to him coming to live in Thorne was a resident of Cawood township.
The terribly sad and tragic affair ham greatly shocked the residents of the usually quiet neighborhood in which it occurred, and a great deal of sympathy is felt for the relatives, who have been so suddenly overcome with a volume of grief

The other day at a gathering at one of the Experimental Farms there was some spirited discussion about the value <>l newspapers. There was not a dissenting voice in the view that the “Family Herald and Weekly Star," Montreal, is the beet all round family newspaper in America, and it will hold its own with any m

Mr. J. J. Mackey, of the Mackey House, North Bey, formerly of Vembroke, and well known in the Ottawa valley, is assured a fortune. He and Mr. J. L. Caverhill, also of North Bay, are two of the owners of the originul hnd at Lake Wa vs in the Michipicoten gold district. They have bought the interest of Mr. Dickenson, the third patty, and the latter who has been an invalid for many year», has become prostrated by the excitement over the gold mine. Mr. Mackay is con
tident that the mine i« * "ne* eays it is worth at least $200,000, and, if it proves as rich as assays indicate, it will be one of the best mines in Canada or the Northwest Territory. Mr. Mackay says the mine will be developed soon and a stamp mill installed as soon as possible.
