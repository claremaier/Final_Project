What is your idea of fame ?
Fame f Well, in its finest phase, I think it is the incredulous surprise which a man’s home folks exhibit when he does anything noteworthy.
Looking out over the many homes of this country, we ends of women wearing away their lives In household drudgery that mignt be materially lessened by the use of a few cakes of SA POLIO. If an hour is saved each time a cake is used, if one less wrinkle gathers upon the face because the toil Is lightened, she must be a foolish woman who would hesitate to make the experiment, and he a churl* ish husband who would grudge the few cents which it costs.
If your grocer sends you anything In place of SAPOLIO, send It back and Insist upon having just what you ordered. SAPOLIO always gives satisfaction. On floors, tables, and painted work it acts like a charm. For scouring pots, pans, and metals it has no equal Everything shines after it, and even the children delight in using 1» in their attempts to help around the house.

And
New York, Nov. 1.—The Sun to-day prints a letter from Juneau, Alaska, outlines what purports to be a raid into Brit ish territory and the capture of Dawson City. Tim letter bears the date Juneau,
Alaska, Oct. 21, and reads as follows

The story comes here from United States Commissioner J. N. Smith at Dyea and it has general belief at this place.

Marshal at Circle City, are said to be the chief filibustered. Jones did not get to St. Michael’» promptly on his appointment, and it was said at once that he had resigned, so Sheppard, of Nebraska, was appointed in his place. Both Jones and Rutledge are venturesome fellows ; quite capable of conceiving and trying to carry AND ACTIVE I °ut ®uch a scheme.
