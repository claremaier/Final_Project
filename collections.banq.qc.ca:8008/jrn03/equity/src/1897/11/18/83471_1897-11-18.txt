The Financial Times, London, writes the Canadian gold country as follows; In general terms we alt know that there are difficulties in the way of getting to the goldfields on the Yukon Hiver. Hut, speaking for ourselves, we had not the faintest conception of the extent of these difficulties until we read in this month’s Strand Magazine, an interview with Mr. Harry de Wtadt, a well-known —almost1 famous—explorer, who has been there. The recital of the obstacles in the way of getting to the fields would make m hi-metal list chortle in his joy, were It not for the fact that Mr. de Windt predicts that all the troubles will ultimately he overcome. His statements bear the unmistakable Impress of truth, impartiality and intelligence.
