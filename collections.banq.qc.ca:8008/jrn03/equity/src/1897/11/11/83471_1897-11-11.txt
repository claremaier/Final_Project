Such was Norry, the uncrowned queen of a remote little town on the edge of a glorious Irish lake. Like the Oriental philanthropist, she loved her fellow men. Her existence was kised on the first law of Christianity, with such a surprising result that her fellows of all classes, creeds, sexes and ages, worshipped her.
She was not of the order of female infant that is content to stay in-doors and play with dolls. Nor were outdoor games the chief delight of her life. What she liked was the making and sustaining of universal acquaintances.
She awoke with the dawn preoccupied with the fortunes of Tommy This and Molly That, and chattered aliout them while she graciously submitted to the encroachments of soaps, water, Kith tow el and brush, and she was still discoursing of them in passionate interludes while Marcella fed her upon bread and milk and porridge in the kitchen.
She it was who welcomed all newcomers into the town—tramps, travellers and visitors. Her formula was as rigid and unchanging as royal etiquette. She drew no line lietween beggars and noblemen, but simply said to the trousered male

There are not in Europe two countries that seem to hate each other, more than England and Germany. The two Governments are lens inclined to quarrel than the people. This mutual dislike has now risen to such an extent that English papers say in so many words, "Germany must be deal roye<l.

The Canadian Pacific Railway authorities and the Dominion immigration officers look for a p he nominal rush of immigrants In the corning spring from England to the Klondike. Whin the news of the wonderful riches of that region reached England there was little time for preparations on a large scale and only a limited number of individuals started for the Yukon districts. Since then !arg“ companies have been organized, men have aubsr large sums of money, and in the h. ug they will be able to furnish men ready to start out for the gold regions.
In addition the Dominion agents report that considerable nuinl>ers of persons in all parts of the United Kingdom having small means are simply waiting for spring to join their fortunes to the thousand# who will be ready to rush into the Yukon from all parts of the world. Those who have recently come from England arc full of the Klondike, and state that it is the great cry all over the country, and it will increase rather than diminish, as the spring approaches. The excitement, particularly in London. when some of the great finds were announced, bordered on delirium, and nothing but the insuperable difficulties of the route, at an advanced season of the

The means for bringing to light falsified numbers on debentures, are wdrth being brought under the notice of stock brokers and bankers
live first spreads the suspected debenture on a well-lighted table with a number of others, and sets them one by one beside it. The genuine numbers are always written with clerkly regularity. The ¦¦ them did so mechanically ; but a forger's hand is always influenced by hope or fear. It is not probably, his business to do nothing hut write figures and fill up forms. It nearly always happen# that his state of feeling is be-yed in the more symmetrical figures of his forgery. The next thing to notice is the difference in the color of the ink. It is never of the same shade as that in the original. Should it be darker or lighter the suspected debenture is taken to a dark room and placed under a strong reflectorMBBUllWW that did not appear are now seen. The unaltered figures are shiny, because t he ink is oxydized ; the new ones are of a duller black. In some angles of the light, one does not see the original figures at all, but the added ones plainly. They are then damped with alcohol to make the paper transparent. The difference, of character between what was first written and what was added is thus brought out more distinctly.
A magnifying-glass is next used. Tremors of the hand, skilful scratching#. and alterations of figures are made manifest. On the wrong side of the numbers being lightly brushed with plombagine, the new figures stand out in stronger relief than tne old. The final operation is * 'the wash, ' of the debenture. It is first washed with a camel's hair brush dipped in a mixture of one pert of castor oil to six parts of alcohol at a he*t of ninety-fiva degrees. The primitive figures now appear more distinctly than the added One#. The second w ash is of soda and water in the proportion of two to a hundred.
