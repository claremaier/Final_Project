Resolution of Condolence*
At a regular meeting of Elmside Lodge I. O. G. T., No. 160, the following resolution was unanimously carried :
Whereas it has pleased Almighty God I Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and Congress to remove from earthly scenes our brother of Rough Riders of the World is now the late William Henry Miller, resolved touring in this direction, and will appear that we the members of Elmside Lodge I. at Ottawa, Ont., on June 28th and 29th.

Buffalo Bill himself has become - national character, known all over the country, and it is no small compliment to him to say that many of the thousands of people who have crowded into the place of exhibition, have been largely actuated by motives of curiosity to see so celebrated a personage. During the recent New York engagement at Madison square Garden, even that immense structure proved inadequate to properly accomodate the crowds, and hundreds were turned away from the doors each night, unable to even obtain standing room.

In Chicago it is said, on reliable authority, out of 105 virulent cases only one death resulted.
0Dr. Bracelin calls his discovery “the correct chlorine treatment,” and the name perfectly describes it. The method of attacking the disease is by inhalations of chlorine gaa—a powerful germacide and prophylactic mg employment of which Dr. Braceli possible by means of a chemical treatment which destroys the caustic and irritating properties which have hitherto made administration by the respiratory organs impossible.

both the children had diphtheria, and administered antitoxin serum. The children grew worse, and on the Thun-following Dr. Prendergast called Dr. T. R. Horn blower, of No. 031 Bergen avenue, in consultation. Three injections of anti toxin were given to the children. They grew rapidly worse. Dr. Hornblower had met J. J.
Russell, whom ex Senator McPherson had induced to come to Jersey City to introduce the Bracelin treatment, and he suggested to Dr. Pendergast that they try chlorine inhalations. Dr Prendergast demurred. The little boy who was the worst off, died at midnight on Thursday, and the girl lay at the point of death.
•‘I saw it was a last chance," said Dr. Prendergast, to try chlorine
little girl had reached the stage preceding total collapse. Her breathing was labored and rapid, her pulse high and feeble, and her face had assumed the bluish-purple hue which shortly precedes death.
“I removed as much of the membrane from the throat as I could, and then Mr.
Russel applied the chlorine vapor. The child was too far gone to inhale the gas, and we had to blow the medicated air into her lungs through a tube.
“The result was marvellous. Her breathing soon became easier, her cheeks grew ruddier and her pulse became stronger and more regular. I had been up with the children for several nights, and finally went home and left Mr. Russell to continue the treatment at intervals during the night.
“When I returned at 7 o’clock next morning the child was oat of danger and on the road to recovery. When l called again she was out of bed and playing marbles on the floor. It was a wonderful cure of one of the most malignant cases of diphtheria I have ever attended.

SUMMER qbOTHBS.
There was never a time when the woman of moderate mean# could clothe herself and little ones in such dainty and beautiful garments as the present, for there was never a time when dimities, lawn# and muslins of all kinds could be had in such lovely colors and patterns, or at such moderate prices as now. Linen and cotton goods in linen color are popular materials, either for summer dresses or the ever popular shirt waists. The latter are worn with cuffs and collar of the name material, or of white linen There are several advantages in making the ruffs and collars separate, since they are the parts of the waist that are soiled first, and may be laundered without washing the whole waist. So great is the variety of materials used for waists that it would seem an easy matter to suit any taste and purse.

A girl of eight has a of pale blue and white dimity, made with a full skirt, finished at the lower edge with a wide hem. The wauit has a square yoke, to which the lower part is gathered. One ripple ruffle edged with lace Is sewed in with the top of
the sleeve, and another is placed over the shoulders, extending from the hack to the front, and leaving a space in the middle four inches wide at the lower edge of the yoke. The sleeves are plain with lace at the lower edge, and the neck is finished with s straight lMind.
