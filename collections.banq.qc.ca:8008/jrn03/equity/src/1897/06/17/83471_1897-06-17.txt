A complete wreck of domestic happiness has often resulted from badly washed dishes, from an unclean kitchen, or from trifles which seemed light as air. But by these things a man often judges of his wife’s devotion to her family, and charges her with general neglect when he finds her careless in these particulars. Many a home owes a large part of its thrifty neatness and its consequent happiness to 8APOLIO.

___ Mothots Mills, Que., June 11.—The
w - house of Alphonse Laroche, two miles 5% away from this place, was destroyed by I tire this morning at five o’clock. Their I I only child, a young boy, four years old, I perished in the flames. Although efforts I were made to save him it was impossible.
I It is reported in Liberal circles this I morning, says the Montreal Star of Wed-J nesday last, that Mr. F. X. Lemieux, the I member-elect for Bonaventure and I Levis counties in the Provincial Legis-I lature, was on the war path because he T had nut been given a portfolio, and that ! he had induced Mr. Charles Langelier, - the former Provincial Secretary, to be a candidate in the Magdalene Islands against Mr. Charles Marcil, who is ac cepted as the Government candidate. It is certain that neither Mr. Francois nor Mr. Charles Langelier are statistied with
JEWELLERY l^e treatment they have received at the
hands of their friends, whether at Ottawa or Quebec, while Mr. Lemieux has not , concealed his dissatisfaction since the I formation of the provincial Cabinet.
Take advantage of these facts and place your order with us.
