A REAL LUXURY I
Looking out over the many homes of this country, we see thousands of women wearing away their lives in household drudgery that might be materially lessened by the use of a few cakes of SAPOLIO. If an hour is saved each time a cake is used, if one less wrinkle gathers upon the face because the toil is lightened, she must be a foolish woman who would hesitate to make the experiment, and he a churlish husband who would grudge the few cents which it costs.
If your grocer sends you anything in place of SAPOLIO, send it back and insist upon having just what you ordered. SAPOLIO always gives satisfaction. On floors, tables, and painted work it acts like a charm. For scouring pots, pans, and metals it has no equal. Everything shines after it, and even the children delight in using it in their attempts to help around the house.
tir Grovers often substitute cheaper goods for SAPOLIO to mak> a better profit. Send back such articles and insist on having just what you ordered -

right of appeal.
Last, and by no means least, is the permission accorded to the zemstvos, or county and district councils, to appeal directly tx> the Czar against veto interference on the part of the Provincial Governor or County Deputv Governor. Each zemstvo is support to have full control of the local affairs of the district which it represents, its members being ejected by the taxpayers. But untU a year ago every decision of the council, no matter whether it related to schools, the management, of hospitals, the relief of the poor, or what not, was subject, to the veto of the Governor of IhépP veto was used in such arbitrary fashion that it practically deprived the councils of all power.
they liOHsessed the right of appeal to the Czar, hut according to the rules and regulations devised by lhe bureaucrats and officials, the appeal of the council to the Czar against the veto of the Governor could only be transmitted to the throne through the Governor in question himself. The result was that out of 1,000 appeals from zemstvos during the first two gears of the present reign not more twenty actually reached the Em-
