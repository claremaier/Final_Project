The Laurier Government has a new mission. It is to abolish rweat-ahop labor. One of its ways of doing this is to fix the customs duties so that the product of sweat shop labor in other countries can be imported more cheaply into Canada, to compete with the output of home factories. —Montreal Gazette.
A Canadian immigration agent who has been some time in Kansas reports to the Department of the Interior that there is great probability of a large emigration next spring from that state to Canada. The farmers have suffered a loss of their crops for several years and are looking for new fields in which to begin operations over again. They have delegated men to come north and study conditions in Canada and these men are now going over the Northwest and Manitoba. It will depend much on the manner of reply they make whether the flow of immigration comes up to the expectations. There are many ex Canadians in the state of Kansas, and these particularly are anx iousto return.
