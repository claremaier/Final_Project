A queer state of affairs exists in Aylmer. Since the waterworks were put in many people put sewer pipes iuto their unused wells, and all their slops go into these wells. It is now pointed out that this dreadful state of affairs will ruin the health of the town.

Thomas McDonaugh. son of Wm. Me-Donaugh, who lives about five miles above Dacre, was killed by a falling tree on September 28th, while engaged in one of McLachlan Bros.' lumber camps. This is the second of Mr McDonough’s family who has met with a violent death, the first, a young man, having been killed a few years ago through a runaway accident.
The Pembroke Observer gives a glow ing description of the Fair held at Beach burg on the 1st inst., which it accounts the most successful iu the history of the society. Amongst the prize winners we notice that some of our Clarendon farmers have shown up excellently. Messrs. Edward, Joseph and John Brownlee cap tured a fair share of the first and second prizes in the different classes for swine, taking every thing in Poland China class. In sheep Messrs. Edward and U. A. Brownlee also did well.
Consigned to the Tomb—The remains of the late Mr. Donald McLean, of Quyon, whose sudden and lamented death briefly noted in these columns last week, were consigned to their last resting place at Pontiac cemetery on Thursday last, in the presence of a very large as •embly of relatives and sympathetic friends. At ten o'clock the remains were taken from deceased's late residence, whence the procession wended its way to . Church. The following gentle-fulfilled the duty of pall bearers : Messrs Willie McOormac, Willie Camp bell, Harry Ferguson, T. E. Hodglns, Hugh Mulligan, jr., Daniel O'Neill.
John A McAdam acted as funeral director. At the church (which was Inadequate to hold the large attendance) a solemn High Mass in Requium was celebrated by Rev. Father Mclnerney, after which the procession re formed, and proceeded to the cemetery, about four miles distant, where the last sad duty was performed.
To those who knew him personally, and especially to the people of Quyon, Mr. McLean s death comes as a very deeply
regretted event, kindly, genial, whole hearted persons, who could scarcely fail to win the friendship and esteem of every one with whom he came in contact. In matters pertaining to the welfare of his own village, he was ever teady to lend a willing and a generous hand ; and to those in need he has often proved a warm and sympathetic friend. To the many who mourn his early death, the burden of the grief will naturally fall upon hie brothers and sisters, his aged mother and hie bereft wife and child, all of whom have the deepest sympathy of the community iu their affLc-

Wrecked a Waggon.—The P. P. J. train coming west on Thursday evening last ran into a team and waggon belong ing to a farmer named Paine, at a crossing not far from Parker’s station, and made a complete wreck of the waggon and load of flour which it contained, although, strange to say, the driver and team escaped injury. When the accident occurred, the tram was brought to a stop as quickly as possible, and a number of those aboard went back to ascertain the extent of the damage. They found Paine in a rather dazed condition, scarcely knowing what had happened, but unhurt. The horses had freed themselves from the wreck and disappeared, while the load of flour was scattered in all directions. It was remarkable that Paine was caught in the manner described, as the engineer careful to give the usual note of warning on approaching the crossing.

Looking out over the many homes of this country, we see thousands of women wearing away their lives in household drudgery that might be materially lessened by the use of a few cakes of SAPOLÎO. If an hour is saved each time a cake is used, if one less wrinkle gathers upon the face because the toil is lightened, she must be a foolish woman who would hesitate to make the experiment, and he a churlish husband who would grudge the few cents which it costs.
If your grocer sends you anything in place of SA POLIO, send It back and insist upon having just what you ordered ways gives satisfaction. On floors, tables, and painted work it acts like a charm. For scouring pots, pans, and metals it has no equal. Everything shines after it, and even the children delight in using it in their attempts to help around the house.
HT Grocer» often substitute cheaper good* for SAPOLIObo make a better profit. Send back such articles and insist on haring Just what you ordered
