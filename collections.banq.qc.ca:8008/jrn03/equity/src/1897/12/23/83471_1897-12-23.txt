The Province’s Finances.

UJILJ
The figure of the public accounts of OUDIOTMAC the province for 18% 97 showed a deficit Ufi IllO I lYIMO
. that came unpleasantly close to the mil
lion dollar mark. Fur 1897 98 the year IQ UdMIUP now nearly half done,’*the Treasurer *»»• ! ¦ V UUlwl III Ue
ticipatea another deficit, the size of which he has not publicly estimated. For the next fiscal year (1898 99) he expects a revenue of $4,081,991) and an expend! turo of $4,061,884. If nothing unforeeen occurs there will be the twelve months ending eighteen months hence, be a sur-p us of $50,000 This is the kind of a tale that has been told so often by Quebec financiers that people would hardly feel that the foundations of the consti tutioo were safe if it was departed from.
Things never are, but always to be blest.
The happy time when the treasurer’s worries shall cease is ever just in the future Mr. Marchand, unfortunately for
himself and for the province, is not likely | Girls will W£Ult to see. that happy time. He lacks the courage of the convictions he must have felt. He is like too many nf his prede cessore He was confronted with a situ ation that called for courageous action.
Instead of bringing the revenue up to tire needs of the case as he sees them, he is going into the money market to borrow in order to make up deficits between the income and the ordinary necessary expenses of the province. There is no reasonable expectation that there will be a surplus in the operations of 1898 99. , ,
The supplementary estimates for the | <11 Ways want present year are twice as large as the difference between income and outgo calculated on next year. Forty thous and dollars is not a sufficient margin for unexpected demands in a province where anything and everything almost is made the excuse for a demand on the provincial treasury. The estimates for next y«ar bear evidence of having been framed in a spirit of economy ; but that is one reason why the expenditure they provide fur is [n addition W6 haV© til© FegU-likely to be exceeded. After the $1,000 required fur interest on the debt
is taken from the $4 091,999 of anticipated I Groceries ordinary revenue there is really little left 1 considering the charges the Quebec treasury is called on to meet. The opportun | mirrors itiee for cutting off are limited, and the closer the cutting the larger likely to be the demands in the supplementary estimates that never fail to make their ap pea ranee. Mr. Marchand is not out of the woods. He is not following the course to take him out of the woods. It is not the floating of more bonds the province needs ; but more revenue
