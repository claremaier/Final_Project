Roaring mirth greeted the late farmer as he crawled over the fence.

striking one. Upon the capital of a mil lion and a hajf, a net profit has been earned during the past year of $201,483, equivalent to nearly 13J p.c. A slight ad dition to the credit of profit and loss, an addition of $60,000 to the bank’s reserve (bringing it up to $1.125,000, or three fourths of the entire capital), a dividend of 8 p.c. and a bonus of 1 p.c.—these indicate the use made of the year's profit.
Making every allowance for the improvement in general businesa in Canada during the past year, the Bank of Ottawa’s report seems to prove beyond question that there has been great business ability in its management. With this able handling and with the continued promise of national prosperity, and the develop* j ments in the far west which are particular ly likely to increase the business of oui leading financial institutions, the shareholders of the Bank of Ottawa seem to be in an extremely satisfactory position.
