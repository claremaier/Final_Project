Mr. Hugh Conn, who advertised he would be here on Friday last for the purpose of buying horses, had about one hundred animals to choose from on that date, notwithstanding that the weather was very disagreeable and many of the parties had to come a considerable distance. But the kind of horses offered ^ j were not exactly what Mr. Conn was in need of, consequently he only purchased a few. It seems the horses required for lumbering purposes, and must be heavy, sound animals not over eight years old. Had Mr. Conn been buying for the Crow’s Nest Pass Railway

Carriages can pass each other by an ingenious arrangement of rollers attached at intervals to either side of t he conducting w ire, the trolley being guided to the right or left as may lie necessary.

SESSIONAL NOTES.
john smith. CABBING
On Wednesday last the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne was moved by Dr. Belaud, the member for Beauce, in a brilliant speech, in French, and seconded in a speech in English by Mr McCorkhill, the new member for Miaaisquoi.
Hon. Mr. Flynn, who has been chosen leader of the Opposition, replied criticizing the Speech from the Throne at length with characteristic dignity and eloquence, after which Premier Marchand spoke in defence of the Government, contending, among other things, that the dismissal of certain public officials was justifiable. The address was then adopted without amendment, although Mr. Pelletier stated that the Opposition's consent to this course was not to be understood as approv ml of the Speech.

ORDERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE

Another interprovincial bridge may be built between Ottawa and Hull, this one to be between Bank street and Eddy's lumber yard in Hull, on the east side of the Hull Court House. For some time past a number of the members of the Hull Electric Company have been discussing plans for & proposed bridge. They have the plans prepared and already tenders are in for parts of the bridge. The company through their solicitors, Messrs Parkins and Fraser, are now applying for incorporation.
Upon inquiry the Journal learned that the bridge will be what is known as a high I -w a- x-t level cantilever bridge. It will be fifty 1 xVLCvJTvIIa 6 S feet wide and will have double tracks for railway purposes, two driveways, and two walks for pedestrians. The trestles will be thirty five feet high and the piers will be 160 feet apart.
The bridge is being built as a commercial enterprise. Tolls will be collected from cars and vehicles, although pedestrians and bicycles will probably lowed to pass free of charge. T motors do not intend asking for bonuses from either Hull or Ottawa. The company intend asking the government fer the privilege of building any place between Bank and Kent streets.
At present it is the intention to place the bridge so that the Ottawa end will be close to Kent street, but in case it is necessary to change this, owing to engineering difficulties the promoters expect to have the right to build any place be tween Bank and Kent streets. They will expropriate any property owners whoso land they may require.

Murder at St. Canute.

Having determined to double our attendance and give you the advantages of our practical business and shorthand courses, we have something important to tell you regarding fees, etc. Do not fail to write for particulars. Fall term begins August 1st.
St. Canute, a small village in this province, has been the scene of a horrible murder—that of Ovide Poirier, who was found with his throat cut from ear to ear on Monday of last week. Suicide was as oribed at first, but now the case is firmly believed to be a foul murder.
Liter intelligence . of the affair says | Ï, that Pi i.ier’s wife, and a man named Samuel Parslow, who had been p'aced under arrest, have made a confession that they killed Poirier, the woman holding the victim while the man cut his throat.
