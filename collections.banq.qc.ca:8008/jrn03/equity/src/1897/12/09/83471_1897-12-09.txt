An instance is recalled of one whs did all her own. sewing. Yet she wa* never satisfied with her efforts. ?( she expressed it, she "always felt se home-made."

Without the loss of a second they yanked a big ladder off the carriage and had it planted to the roof of the house to the west.
Before this ladder was well placed a stream of firemen ran nimbly up it.
The second man carried a lighter ladder, which be planted on the roof of the smaller building, leaning up against the blank wall of the building in which the fire raged.
By this time the position of the boy was well-nigh unendurable. It seemed but a few seconds before he must let go.
There was a cry of horror from the crowd when the firemen placed the second ladder in position. It would not reach the boy by several feet.

A despatch to the Ottawa Journal, from Chickens 4 4	44	.
Pembroke, dated Dec. 4, eayi Thomas Costello, of Renfrew, is under arrest on a charge of bigamy. Thomas, if all rep are true, is a much married man. H a native of Pembroke, and some years ago made himself prominent about Pembroke by capturing a prisoner named Scott who had escaped from the constable while being conveyed to Pembroke jail.
This act resulted in having him appointed to the county constabulary, and shortly after the official dignity was conferred on him, as was meet and proper, he married Eliza Ann Coburn, daughter of William Coburn of the township of Alice. The ceremony was performed by Archdeacon Daykin, at Holy Trinity Church, Pern broke, on the 22nd of May, 1888.
But Thomas didn’t prosper and mayhap hie domestic relations were not as happy as he had fondly anticipated. At all events he left Pembroke and the wife of hie bosom during the summer to seek prosperity and happiness in other quarters
have made the heart grow fonder, for it seems he neglected hie wife, and ao far forgot her existence as to woo and win i the pledge of love and obedience from an Aylmer, Que., belle
Thomas married this lady during the fall of 1888 The ceremony was performed at Portage du Fort. Still happiness was denied him. He was still ill mated but undaunted. Wife No. 2 didn’t suit and had to go by the boards.
He left her and sought for other conquests, and not without success, it is said.
The authorities say that Mr. Costello’s ardent love succeeded in winning the heart of Flora McPherson, of Ottawa, to whom he was married on the 26th of May 1893. Flora seems to have suited his tastes, for they say through all vioissi* tudea she has continued to remain with him. Latterly Mr. Costello and hie wife No. 3 have been living in Renfrew in apparent happiness.
Wife No. 2 of Aylmer never took very kimdly to her desertion and sought far and wide for her lost Thomas. Perseverance was rewarded being in Renfrew and of hie escapades in the matrimonial field. She was not to be blamed for being indignant and hei injured feelings led her to lay an information against the false Thomas for bigamy.
Justice of the Peace G. W. McDonald of Renfrew received the information and put the matter in the hands of Chief Bar. ney McDermott, who arrested Costello, and brought him up before Magistrate i McDonald/ who committed him to stand I his trial at Pembroke for bigamy.
During his rather unisvoury career Costello has assumed several aliases, he having married the Aylmer girl under the name of Brndie. Subsequently he turned up at Bristol Mines as James Brown, and understand we went by some other name while at Billerica, a place, by the way,
some rather bitter recollections.
Costello, who was arraigned before Judge Deacon at Pembroke on Tuesday last, pleaded entity, and was sentenced to 18 motill • in Central prison.

plan is followed, becomes more worthless. The real poultry fancier follows an exactly opposite planfjjjfBB' the I wet in each broud, and they are the ones he keeps for breeders. The farmer's plan, therefore, runs down the.vigor and profitable qualities of his poultry flock, and the poultryman's method builds It up. Many poultry-men sound an alarm about the dangers of inbreeding. Where nature's course is followed there is little or no danger resulting. In the case of partridges, pheasants and other wild or un domesticated birds the "weakest go to the wall" and the robust and vigorous one» survive and become the progenitors of another season’s increase try-raiser follows, therefore, the plan of birds in their wild state by saving for breeders the strongest and best. Where this plan is intelligently observed the utility qualities can lie made to yearly Improve without the introduction of new blood. In fact where such methods are carried out, unless one is sure that they can secure, a male bird that has been bred on the same fine to maintain vigor, etc., It is safer to use the selected males from the home flock. Those who have never followed selecting and retaining the choice of each season's breeding will be agreeably astonished to find how rapidly they can Improve vigor, size and laying qualities of their hens by

Eggs in winter are the main factor that results in profit in poultry-keeping.

ort McLeod, Oat. lOih, 07.
Dear friends at home,—
We have arrived at our destiny in safety, and have worked three days on buildings here. Fort McLeod is on the prairie. Land and sky are about all tha+ we can see, excepting the Rockies, which tower up into the skies at the north about aeveuty miles distant. 1 will try and give you a short account of our trip, for it was a very good one :
Leaving Ottawa on Saturday evening, Oct. 9ih, we reached Pembroke at dark. We spread our blankets but we did not sleep much, for there was a large crowd on board,and a little gay sometimes. Sunday morning we had a short delay at a station, named Ridout, where our engine broke down. It was raining and blowing all forenoon, and there was very little to be seen but rocks, bush and lakes. About 12 o’clock and while at lunch, we passed some cars fixed up for to live in, and 1 think I saw a young lady from Clarendon looking out of one of the windows. It was a very lonely looking place.
4 o'clock :	It was snowing and sleeting
when we got the first glimpse of Like Superior. It is a fine sight. The water appeared to be very green. The road is high and crooked along here in some places. We went through three tunnels ; the longest one, I think, was about, two hundred feet in length. Next we came to Jack Fish, a fishing village and coal dock, located on the shore. Then Port Arthur and Fort William come next, and are both nice little towns. Leaving these, we tried to sleep and did very well.
Monday, Oct. 11th : Daylight found us at Dryden,—nine stations east of Rat Portage. The country looks better around here, but it is rocky and heavily wooded. We arrived at Rat Portage at noon. It appeared to be quite a busy place, and plenty of miners were to be seen. The I town is situated on the northern aide of a rocky hill. There are quite a number of good buildings here, but most of them are laborers’ houses. Passing along, we get a fine view of that great expanse of water called Lake of the Woods. Next we come to the prairie, and our first eight of it—-(about 3 o’clock) —was that part through which the tire had raged, and everything looked black as far aa we could see. About 5 o’clock we arrived at Winnipeg, where we changed cars. We had an hour here, hut it was raining and we were obliged to remain in the station. It get dark early that evening, so we had lunch and went to bed and slept well, as we had become accustomed to the motion of the cars. Tuesday we | were in the Northwest Territories, saw the sun rising, as you would think, out of the grass, for we could not see any thing but land and sky. At 8 o’clock we had reached Grenfell—a fine little town surrounded by a good farming district. The buildings were nearly nil of stone or brick. An hour more and we were at a new town named Indian Head, which presented a flourishing appearance. Here Tom met J. Dale, formerly of Shaw ville, and who has a barbershop in this place. The farms look grand around here. There was a threshingmill work in a a field near the line, and at the time we passed they were getting 75 cents per bushel for the grain A farmer came ou board here, and we had a short conversa tion with him. He told us the harvests had been very good for the past two years.
He said he had about six hundred acres of land, about one half of which was under cultivation, and also stated that he had •old $0,000 worth of wheat this year.
Wednesday morning : inches of snow has fallen, we arrived at Calgary, where we changed cars to proceed south to McLeod. W had an hour here, but it was so much I like winter that we stayed where it was warm. The only accident that occurred was the loss, by a fellow on board, of his hat, which tumbled out of the window, and he was obliged to get off at this place and h nt up a cap.
At 4 o’clock we arrived at McLeod station—about two miles from our work. There was snow on the ground and it was also freezing very hard. We were shown to our lodging, which consisted of a box car. Into this we got a bale of hay I and our blankets, and spent our first ] night in our new home pretty good, 'tho it was at first a little cold. When we ar rived at McLeod, we met four men bring ing a poor fellow in his last box to send him home. He had only been here two] weeks when he died of typhoid fever, ao | * they told us.
There are quite a few ciaes of fever here, caused by the water, which con tains alkali.
The work is steady and also heavy. Board has been very good so far. do not get any pork at all, but we are well supplied with beef, potatoes, bread and butter, dried apples, sugar and tea.
It is very windy out here ; in some ptrts it would blow the clothes off ragged men. Thère are sixty miles of steel laid now, and it is expected that forty miles more will soon be completed, which will connect the line with the mountains this fall. There are some very high bridges going up ; one is over 1G0 feet high, and when completed will contain about a million feet of timber. For good men wages are pretty fair, SI.50 a day being paid to lahoringmen, carpenters earn from $2 00 to $3.00 per day, while teamsters are paid $30 per. month. The teamsters hitch three waggons together, and these are drawn by four teams placed one after the other, and one fellow looks after them all.
I think I will conclude for this time, and I will be able to tell you how we like our new home better in the next letter.
