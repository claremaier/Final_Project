New York, Jan. 18.—The organization of one of the most formidable military expeditions that has yet been prepared in this country by Cuban revolutionism is the real reason for the sudden arrest of Gen. Carlos Roloff, whose examination] Thome was set down for this forenoon.
Gen. Roloff is secretary of war of the Cuban Republic, and by him the expedition was organized.
It is fully equipped with 5,000 Mauser rifles, four rapid fire guns, 2,000,000 rifle cartridge#, 2000 gun cartridges and a large amount of dynamite and hospital stores.
The Spanish agents are frantic lest the expedition should get away and safely
reach the insurgents.
They do not know where the war material ia nor where the expedition is to sail from.	_ „.

The absentee list was not always so large, l*it rarely fell below sixty or
seventy. In other companies the same state of affairs was common. The read-__lwho questioned this statement might satisfy himself of its truth by auctioning any company commander of him acquaintance. How completely this system of shirking had taken possession of the army might lie learned from this letter, written but a few weeks ago by a General who recently had given up the command of an army corps:
"In peace the officers take the privates to their homes to keep the houses in order to go walking with tho children, Ac. The privates live with their masters, and wear civilian clothes. The regulations say, however, that the officers may have at their service only a few privates, whose duty it shall 1* merely to keep the officers' uniforms and weapons in order. The alaises of this narrow privilege are coneealed.ano the more they are concealed t he more they are multiplied. For the one purpose of personal service, aliout ten men arc taken out of every company.
"In Germany the numerical strength of the peace army is fixed beyond the possibility of alteration by the officers.
If one man goes, he is replaced at once by another. Thus the numerical standard remains unchanged. In France the number on paper is always décrivit includes many who are soldiers in name only. In Germany they have, as they aim to have, a certain fixed lighting force. In France we seem to exert ourselves mainly to make a good

The German correspondents in Paris immensely pleased with these utterances, and recall the book of Major de % Nercy, retired, who, writing on The Next War," under the supervision of (i^n. Marquis de Galhffet, told French people, (hat unless the army should be reorganized and disciplined more strictly, the next war with Germany would be likely to end «« disastrously for France as did that of 1870-

At the Scarborough (England) Board of Guardians it-was announced that an old lady who died a few days ago had left all her worldly goods, Including £112 and a gold watch, to the guardians, who, she said, had l>een her best

The old lady has two nieces in Leeds, and it was decided to make inquiries about them before deciding whether to accept the property or not. The deceased made Mr. feniailes, the relieving officer, the sole executor, and before her death when he spoke to her about her nieces, she naid, "What relatives I have are nothing to me.

There was no reason for suspecting the managing clerk—on the contrary, the most implicit confidence was reposed in him, and people were astounded therefore when it was found that the petty cash did not balance to within £80 and some odd shillings. The clerk vehemently protested his innocence, but there was no satisfactory explanation forthcoming, and although the firm were loath to prosecute, they could not, of course, entirely overlook the matter. Accordingly the employe was given the alternative of the dock or retirement from the land of bus birth.

REMOVAL BACK TO OLD STAND.
Oar representative Interviewed Mr. James Brsyley, of Hamilton, at his office, 68 King William Street. Mr Brayley is an enterprising business man, and one of Hamilton's foremost manufacturers. His goods. Saddlery hardware, punches, dies, etc., are known from Halifax to Vancouver, and stand very high in the estimation of the trade.
Mr. Brayley said troubled with gravel and weakness of the kidneys. I had to stand up and clench my teeth when urinating, so intense was the pain. The pains around my loins where almost Intolerable, and I felt as though a cat were being pulled down my back by the bind lege.
"I wont from bad to worse till at last I could not urinate at all, and had to be operated on. I had no confidence in anything, and made up my mtud to suffer torture to my dying day. Heading the testimony published by the Doan Kidney Pille Co., I saw a similar case to my own, and, being in constant agony, decided to give them a trial, and got a box of the pills from Spackman's drug store, at the corner of Market Square.
" It did me no good, so I got another, and another, until I had taken four boxes, and was about giving up when relief came. I continued to take them till the pain loft my back, and I am now as limber as an eel. Instead of getting up a dosen times a night I never get up more than once now. The urine is now perfectly clear and has no sediment of any kind.
“I am delighted to testify in behalf'of Doan's
Kidney Pills, as they cured me after the last ray of hope had fled."
