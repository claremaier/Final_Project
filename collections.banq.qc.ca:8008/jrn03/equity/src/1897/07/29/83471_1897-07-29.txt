A tornado which swept over the Lyle Minn., district a week or so ago, and did 930 000 damage was one of the ro<et freakish cm record.
There were several remarkable capte, among them were those of the Peter Haaison family, living in Lyle. He was building a house and with bis family of six and three visitors
ting supper m the barn, whioh stood just west of the new house. The storm blew the barn, family and house across the prairie. All were carried over fifty feet, while the ruins of the buildings were carried a quarter of a mile.
After striking the lVier Hanson house the storm dodged around Dr. Frazier’s residence, breaking a few windows there and totally demolished the new house of Charles Christian so,i. Dk. ihux.t.-r's barm, (however, went across the prairie in stuah pieces. A cow weighing 1,110 pounds was carried a hundred feet and so badly injured that she had to be killed. A cow that stood beside it and was also carried away, escaped without a.jgcratcb.
Willis £. Bryan saw the storm coming and took his family to the cellar
and had them stand aga nst the west wall. Every stick of timber of the house was blown away and all escaped unhurt, except Mr. Bryan, who had a big rock blown against bis foot as he stood in the cellar.
At Henry Hanson's house was a tightly closed pocket book, containing lltW. The pocket book was afterward found open and lying beside it was a |10 bill. The 9180 had been blown away.	,	,	....

The tornado travelled iog rubber ball, striking in one place, then rising and descending again. After striking Christianson's place »t rose up and dropped again half a mile east, when it struck two barns, then rose again and came down, taking a haxn and granary two mile* cast of Lyle. From there on the storm seems have broken and simply blown as a heavy wind, having lost its rotation.

ORIGIN AND FUNCTIONS.
i .1
The Privy Council is the most ancient administrative institution in Great Britain. In the old Norman days it the only form of Parliament, its

mem tiers being •''hosen by the sovereign to advise him in governing the nation. Of course, with the constitution of Parliament in its preaent form the duties and prerogatives of the Council have become much modified. But it would require a more learned pen than mine to define the line where the authority of Parliament ends and that of the Privy Council begins.
Thus, the Lord President of the Council and a committee of its members are at the head of the entire educational system of the empire, all matters pertaining thereto being directed and controlled by this committee. It is also a committee of the Privy CV»uncil that administers the affairs of the Channel Islands, those of the Isle of Man, curiously enough, belonging to the attributes of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.
Frau von Ratenow was vexed, yet

THEIR UNIFORM AND RANK
All Admiralty business, quarantine, lighthouse, ecclesiastical and charitable affairs of the State are subject to the Privy Council, the meetings of which are usually held at Windsor or at Osborne, in the presence of the sovereign, whose commands, when issued in the form known aa " in council," have in a numl>er of cases the same value in the eyes of the tribunals of the land as statutes duly enacted by the National Parliament.
Councillors have the right of

A Privy Councillor likewise wears a very smart diplomatic uniform of blue and gold, with a cocked hat, and has a right ex-officio to serve as magistrate in any county, whether or not he is qualified by residence or poe-ion of loud.
Privy Councillors rank after Knights of the Garter, and before baronets, and the President of the Privy Council ranks fourth among the great dignitaries of the realm, and before the Prime Minister, the first after the princes of the blood being the Archbishop of Canterbury, the second the Lord High Chancellor, the third the Archbishop of York, and the fourth the Lord President of the Council.
