July 9.—The case of the Queen vs.
A. 8. KifHngton for the larceny of some timber at Gordon Creek in 1894, was called, but owing to the absence of one Keeler, an important witness the Crown stated they were not ready to proceed* and moved that the case be continued to next term. Motion granted.
The Queen vs. J. B. Clarke for defamatory libel. This case was instituted j P.S.—#10.00 Suits guaranteed, against Clarke by James McGregor, for
making and causing to be published the-----------------------------------------
affidavit referred to in the above case,	'	__	_

affidavit he thought was not generally be of Black Hpeckied Granite. Thlflgratilta will lieved.	he found second to none In the market.
Mr. McDougall for the defence, again examined the witness very severely, and elicited the information that he had only heard of the affidavit being shown to parties by Rothschilds ; he was also obliged to acknowledge having that morning in Bryson, in the presence of several jurymen, exhibited a letter very derogatory to the character of the accused,
This letter by request of the defence was produced and read in Court. The letter purported to have been written by some jfarty named Lawrence, who had made inquiries regarding Clarke in the neighborhood of his old home. .It set forth that he was a very bad character generally ; that he had married some widowed lady in the west, to whom he had three children ; had squandered her property, and then deserted her and eloped with her daughter, whom he afterwards desert ed in the States.
Peter Bouillon, contractor of Baie des Peres, testified that Rothschilds had shown him Claike’s affidavit in presence of several parties.
Emmanuel Rothschilds acknowledged the receipt of the affidavit, through his brother Max, who had it forwarded to Ottawa, and admitted having shown it to some of his friends. He gave as hie reason for not taking action thereon the fact that some time previous McGregor had taken away about $2,000 worth of his goods, and notwithstanding that they were found on McGregor’s premises and identified, the magistrates at Baie des Peres did not and would not commit him for theft. From this he concluded he could get no justice there. Harry Durrell again gave evidence much the same as in the previous case.
Mr. Atchison testified to having seen and read the letter written by Lawrence re. Clarke's antecedents.
Clarke,the accused, was the next witness and swore that all the statements in Lawrence's letter were absolutely false, and that his declaration as to McG offer were true in every particular.
Timothy Behan and Peter Bouillon both swore that they would not believe Clarke upon oath. The former gave as his reason that Clarke had sworn to the ownership of the tump line which he (Behan) had made. McDougall cornered the witness on this statement and made him admit that he had not heard him make this statement but had been told he had.
Mr. McDougall here showed that Clarke had not sworn positively to the tump line being his, but to the best of his knowledge that it was. He then addressed the jury at some length, contending that no case was proven against Clarke. While he had a perfect right to make the deposition, if he believed the statements therein were true, it had not been proven that he had In any manner ciiculated or given publicity to those
The Judge in his chargi this view, explaining at th nature of defamatory libel, and the privileges which the law recognized as be-igmg to persons who1 made chargee der this head. He instructed the jury to find a verdict of not guilty against the accused, and this they did without retiring from the court room.
The next case was that of the Queen vs. Alex. McNab, for theft of some timber from a lot in Bristol, the property of one Louis Tremblay, Mr. McDougall appeared for the defense also in this case.
Several witnesses
the evidence went to show that McNab was not a wilful trespasser, but had a color of right foi his action in this regard, from the fact that
lot and that of Tremblay was not very clearly defined, and that he believe! he was cutting wood on hi# own place.
Mr. McDougall contended that the charge in the indictment was not sustained by the evidence ; simmered down it was simply a dispute between two neighbors, and properly belonged to the jurisdiction of the civil courts.
The Judge agreed with this view and directed the jury to find accordingly, which they did.	,
The court then adjourned to five o’clock next morning when His Honor pronouneed a sentence of twenty-two months in the common jail upon the prisoner Digram.

property.
Macduugall subjected
regor
to a rig*.roue cross examination in the course of which it came out, that the tump line alleged to be stolen by Clarke, was the property of one Timothy Behan, who McGregor stated had instructed him to be on the lock out for and take possession of it. It also came out that there was a perceptible disagreement between the declaration which McGregor made before the magistrate when the charge was laid against Claike, and his evidence before the jury. Counsel for prisoner pushed him pretty hard on this point, when the witness declared that his first evidence given before the magistrate was the correct one. In the deposition referred to witness averred that the property stolen was hie own, while his evidence before the jury as well as that of other witnesses made it clear that this was not correct. His deposition also met forth that he had missed the boots and tump line the
day after Claike left, whereas in his evi-
deuce before the jury, he could not be definite how many days had passed from the time of Clarke's departure until he noticed that the articles had disappeared. Asked why he did not proceed against Clarke at an earlier date than he did, knowing through information obtained from Reid that the latter was at Mattawa, and had a tump line in his possession, McGregor stated that the bailiff was busy with the elections at the time and could

not get away.
A young man named St. Onge, employed as a chireboy at McGregor's, testified that he had seen a tump line and a pair of boots in Clarke's possession while the latter was at McGregor’s. He thought the tump line exhibited was the same.
Camille Letour, bailiff of Baie des Perea, sworn, testified that he arrested Clarke at Potewawa river on the 24th of May, 1890. He got warrant for his arrest on the 18th of May. He found #| tump line in his possession, but the boots he had on were so worn that he could not identify them with the description he had of those stolen. In reply to Mr. Me Dougall he stated that he had settled several bills for McGregor at Mattawn, among them b bill for ltoid a board. Ho also stated that he would have been prepared to execute the warrant for Clarkes arrest at any time had it been given him ? the elections would not have interfered
with him in this regard.
Timothy Behan, sworn, said he was a shoemaker by trade, and had worked in Gillies' shanty with Clarke ; they bunked together. He had a tumpline which he kept under his head in the bunk ; when Clarke went away he missed the tump line, and suspected Clarke of taking it : sent word to McGregor to be on the look out for it, and keep it for him. He identified the tump line exhibited as his

|Çr the defence, Rev. Mr. Black, Presbyterian Minister of Bryson, testifaed that he had known Clarke for 15 years, and had known his character to be gener-good.
Henry Burrell swore Clarke for four years, part of which time he had worked in the woods with him, and from what he knew his character w&a
generally good.	.	.	,
Emmanuel Rothschild*, merchant of Baie des Peres, testified that he had known Clarke for 3 or 4 years ; he had clerked for Buell, Hurdman & Co.; had a pretty good reputation. Further evidence on the part of the witness elicited the fact that very strained relations existed between he and McGregor, also that Clarke bad made a declaration before magistrate Rankin of Mattawa to the ef feet that he (Clarke) had been offered one hundred dollars to set fire to Rothschilds premises. The witness met Clarke some time afterwards, and the latter asked him if he intended to take action on the affidavit made. Witness answered no, as there was no use, aa he would have no
show at Baie des Perea.
The prisoner, John B. Clarke was next examined. He gave his age as 28, and said he hailed from Wellington Co., Out., and was born within 2* miles of Fergus. He then made a categorical denial of all the charges contained in the indictment. He admitted having slept with Behan, but denied the theft of the tump line, claiming to have had one of his own. (The line in the Crown’s possession was here shown him, and he declared that so far as he could judge between two tump lines, and not having seen his since it was taken from him in May, 1896, that the exhibit was hia property.) Witness told of the offer made him by McGregor if he would burn out Rothschilds, and how he had refused it, and left hie place that night for Malta wb; he had subsequently engaged to work with Hurdhian & Co., with whom he was working at the time of h,'s.*ri*e8t in May. He knew the man Reid but slightly ; had met him at McGregors.
This completed the case, and Mr. Me •Dougall proceeded to address the jury. He recounted the circumstances, as brought out by the evidence in the and argued with much force that nothing

The Prince of Wales retiree late but rises early. He is described as a thorough man of business and the ooul of punctuality. His first breakfast is served at 0 o'clock in lus own sitting room, after which he opens his correspondence himself, answers personal letters and indicates on the margin of others what repliés lie wishes bis Secretary to make. Sir Francis Knoll vs fills this position, while Miss Knollys is companion and indeed other self to the Princess. Alwmt 11 o'clock the Comptroller arrives and interviews the Prince daily, after which he drives out. or may be seen walking up Ht. James street, or going to York or Clarence llouse on foot. Even to a greater extent than the Primness he is in demand at public functions. These are of every description, and, bored or not, his duty must tie done. In truth, hie unfailing amiability, and also that of his wife, is proverbial, ty lias earned them the reputation of being the most popular pair in the British Isles.
