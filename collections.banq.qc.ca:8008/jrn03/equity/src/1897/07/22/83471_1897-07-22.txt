Kearly Lost Sis Eyesight.
Mr. W. W. Boucher, V. 8., of Falls & Boucher, met with a very disagreeable accident the other day at Skeads Mill's. He had gone to Skeads professional call, and carried in hie medicine bag a bottle of ammonia, which is very explosive in summer. It flew into his face burning h s eyes and mouth badly. He drove three miles into Ottawa before he received any medical treatment. He has been treated by Drs. Scott and Court-and is progressing rapidly towards recovery. It was a narrow escape for his eyesight, but it is not thought that the injury will be permanent.
Accounts collected and prompt return# made.
All couru attended.

ly and solely because he was dead fact that he died three months before the election took place makes his conduct during the campaign all the more reprehensible. Postmaster* have no right—they have absolutely no right we say—to take an active part in politics even if they are living. It is infinitely worse to keep up their offensive partizanship after they are dead. We are not informed just what part Mr. Lefebre took in the last elections, but we surmise he marshalled the graveyard vote for the Conservative party. Mr. Mulock did perfectly right rn dismissing the late Mr. Lefebre from hie office.

NEW REOtoNS FOUND.
Captain Healey tells of new regions which have been discovered. Indeed, the captain says that no leas than $4 worth of gold is scooped up with every » | shovel of dirt and that applies to every piece of ground into which the shovel ie delivered. Salaries to miners are not lees than $12 a day and a man can get his provisions and sustenance for $2.	•• There
is no doubt” said Mr. Wears, “ that the vein# of gold are only partly uncovered. All my despatches agree that this is the continuation of the mother vein in this country. Von Humboldt, upon his visit to Dutch harbor, near Bristol Bay, predicted that the mother vein would show itself in Alaska in a parallel line. Everything indicates the truth of this prophecy.
Circle City and Fort Cudahy were the principal gold fields before the Clondyke fields were discovered last fall, and the rush for these fields has continued since. Gold fields have also been discovered of great value in the vicinity of Noatak river which is British territory, but the travel has been and continues to be, towards the Yukon fields. This year the number of miners in the territory has been increased by 2,000 to which muet be added 4,000 miners already situated there. Most of these miners come from the Silver mines and push through the wild country and over the mountains. In this way the distance is only 1,000 miles while the water route covers 3,000 miles. Mr. Wears has also news of a new discovery of gold fields hitherto untouched, near the mouth of Tanana river which is the second largest river of A laaka and enters the Yukon it the town of Wears.

A FURTHER ACCOUNT.
Seattle, Wash., July 18 -Sixty-fight passengers on the North American Transportation & Trading Company’s ¦ ship Portland reached Seattle and gallon this morning at nine o'clock, direct from St. Michael’s, at the mouth of the Yukon river, in Alaska. The passengers were mostly miners, and they came diieot from the Kloudyke placer mining dim trict. The men brought back one and a half tons of gold in nugget# and dust. In round numbers it is worth $1,000,000. From St. Francis to the furthermost point in Alaska the ooaet is wild with the excitement growing out of the fabulous finds in the Klondyke, which is a liver ptying into the Yukon, in the North-it Territory. It is fifty miles by river from Forty Mile, on the Alaska boundary, to the scene of the recent finds, and about forty miles in a straight line. The dis coverer of the Klondyke placer diggings was George McCormack, a poor miner, who was known as Siwash George. The first claim warn staked on Bonanza creek ptying into the Klondyke, on August h last. Since that time 400 claims 1 have been located, and the population of

Cape Town, July 14.—The newspapers here declare that the announcement made at the banquet of the St. George Club in London, on Saturday night, by Mr. Geo. J. Goshen, first Lord of the Admiralty, that Cape Colony had presented a first-class battleship to Great Britain was premature. The matter is still in indefinite shape. Parliament has arisen, and consequently no action can be taken in that direction. The Cabinet is now especially considering the matter.
