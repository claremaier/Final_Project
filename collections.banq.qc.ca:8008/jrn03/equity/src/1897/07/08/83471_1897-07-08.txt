Mr. C. Turpain, of Bryson, was chosen foreman.
The Grand Jury is composed of the fol-1 lowing gentlemen :
C. Turpain, Bryson; Thomas Bourke, jr., Allumette Island ; John Gibson, Alley u & Cawood ; F.C. DeZouche, Bryson ; W. H. Clarke, Bryson ; Win. Leacy,

D. Fort; John Robitaille, Clarendon, and William McVeigh, Bryson.
At two o’clock on Tuesday the Grand Jury had brought in the following True Bills :
Against L. C. Nez.—Shooting with intent to murder.
Against Susan Gaudreau,—Assault.
Against Alex r. McNabb,—Theft and trespass.
Against Miaael Bigras,—Shooting with intent to kill.
Against J. B. Clarke,—Defamatory libel and theft.
Against James Martin, — Assaulting bail it!’.
The jury also returned “ no bill” in the case of Mary St. Cyr, indicted for theft.
The case against Nez went to trial on Tuesday morning and occupied the great er itart of the day. The evidence for the prosecution clearly established the prisoner’s guilt* and the judge charged strongly against him in addressing the jury.
Ntz had neither lawyers nor witnesses to appear in his behalf ; but during his 12 months' confinement he had written a voluminous defence in French, which he read to the jury in rather eloquent and at times vehement tones. In this document he made no denial of the crime for which he stood on trial but rather a justification for having committed it.
Nez crime is of a two-fold nature.
Briefly told, it is that while living at Bay
de Peres he had got into a lawsuit with a OTTAWA ONT
neighbor, and out of revenge at having • v 1	1	*

dinary purposes. The adoption of the fast Atlantic contract, the Crow’s Nest railway scheme, and the modified Intercolonial project, were the largest financial items in the work of the session.
The session just closed has been essentially a spending session. The Government has struck a financial gait which has astonished, if it has not dismayed, many of the old line Liberals, who were the
backbone of the party.
The legislation of the session has not been so important as it promised to be. Sir Wilfrid Laurier s absence in England is largely responsible for this. The Vte« biscite bill was abandoned on that account while other measures, such as bills to abolish the superannuation system and to repeal the Franchise Act, were set aside to facilitate business. Of the measures that have passed into law, the more important are bills to prohibit alien labor, enforceably only by the Government : to give the Territories responsible govern meut, to make the Controllers Ministers, to provide for regisration of cheese fac •tories, to provide for cold storage transportation, to authorize a fifteen million dollar loan, to authorize the Government to pay bounties on iron and steel, and to levy export duties on logs and materials. One bill, which-attracted considerable attention -the bicycle bill—perished in the Senate with the understanding that if the difficulty is not settled it will bo renewed next year. There war a great deal of private legislation involving railway charters, all ci which are given subject to a Railway Commission, which the Government may hereafter establish.
The closing scenes in the House made it plain that the legislators by regretted their release from duty Liberal side Mr. Tarte s plug hat was a mark for the well aimed missies of the membebehind him. While waiting f«»r the summons to the Senate chamber the members displayed their vocal ability^to the great amusement of each other, last speech of the session was made by Mr. Henderson, when lie congratulated her Majesty on the liberal appropriation the House had made in this her jubilee The call to the Senate, where pro-

The Georgian Bay Canal.
Have commenced operations for the present season.
Mr. McLeod Stewart, ex mayor of Ot « tawa, and the promoter of the Ottawa and Georgian Bay canal, arrived here (says the North Bay Times) on the Soo train Monday evening after having visited both the Soo canals. He was accompanied by Mr. Marcus Smith, M. Inst. C. E., con suiting engineer. The Times had a i* ? conversation with Mr. Stewart, at the Pacific Hotel.
In reply to a query, Mr. Stewart said the change of Government had nothing to do with the canal project. “ There are no politics in this scheme. It is broadly national and broadly imperial. The time was never so opportune for inaugurating the undertaking. It is impossible for me to estimate the possibilities of the scheme. If the Ottawa river navigation is opened to the great lakes it will develop the following industries to an immense degree, viz , pulp, phosphates, nickel* iron and hardwood industries. The canal has been reported favorably on to the imperial authorities, and the imperial idea was
never stronger than at present. .
“ My open letters to the minister of
railways and canals and the minister of interior put the whole matter in a nut shell. Mr. Cooley, C. E., the engineer of the United States Deep Water XX ays Commission, has enunciated the policy that the line of domestic transportation determines the line of foieigu shipment. If that is so and this canal is built, Montreal will be the port of America.
On the Ottawa route there will be

pereed for dinner.
After partaking of refreshments the brethren formed flgdn iu procession and taking a survey of the town wended their way to the exhibition grounds where the program of sports was to be carried out.
The first on the list of sports was a base ball match between the clubs of Campbell’s Bay and Aylmer. While it lasted it was a very interesting game and at first looked as though our county lads “wern’t in it” as the Aylmerites scored quite a lead up to the fourth innings. But in the fifth the Bay team got down to business and reduced the lead by 7 runs. The Aylmer battery having become fatigued at this point of the game the club deemed it unwise to pro-oeed further and the match waa decided in favor of the Bay. The score stood, Aylmer 9, C. Bay 8. Many were disappointed at not seeing it played out.
Some of the foot races and jumps were then pulled off, after which the lacrosse match between the \ oung Capitals, of Sandy Hill, (Ottawa) and Aylmer was proceeded with. This game proved very interesting. Although the Young Caps at call of time were victorious by a score of 6 to 0, it cannot be said they had every thing their own way as the Aylmer buys put up a good game ; but they lacked the combination play of the Caps, which without doubt accounted for their defeat. In the opening game Mr. Poupore, M.P., placed the ball. Mr. R J McCredie, of Ottawa acted as referee, and gave satisfaction to all. By their victory the Young Caps come into possession of
another set of medals.
The teams as they lined up were as

St. Thomas church has been reshingled. Its appearance is certainly improved, and its internal condition ensured.
Mr. J. E. Morris has been wielding the brush of late, doing credit to himself and the house.
We note these improvements with pleasure, and trust they will only be the beginning of a series of similar improvements.
Jubilee and Dominion Days were observed by our citizens in a manner worthy of the places where they were celebrated, and the occasions which gave rise to them.
A lawn social, will be given under the auspices of the ladies of St. Thomas' church, at the parsonage grounds, Bristol Corners, July 14. Much care is being given to the working out of details, and a good time may fairly be predicted.
All the schools close this week to the satisfaction of the commissioners and others, and to the overwhelming joy of teachers and scholars.
