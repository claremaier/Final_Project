was said in
Aylmer, June 26.—It| g Aylmer last night, upon good authority, that the Hull Electric Company intends running a line of electric busses between the terminus of the line at Hull over to Ottawa, to convey passengers from this point to all parts of the adjacent city. This would be a good move it is considered, on the part of the Hull Company, as a transfer to the electric busses would not mean an additional fare to reach any part of the city of Ottawa. It would be a saving to those who have to travel each day between Aylmer and Ottawa, and should increase to a great extent the passenger traffic on the above rond. There ia no doubt Aylmer will shortly become the great residential suburb of Hull and Ottawa ; and it is quite evident that the Hull Electric Company is determined to make it, in every respect, the chiefest point of attraction to the residents in each of the above cities.
