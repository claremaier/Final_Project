river known as the Rocher Funder, which separates the Island from the province of Ontario.
The documents in the transaction were signed by the different parties thereto on Thursday and Friday, and. immediately after the capitalists mentioned left for Galetta, via Renfrew, to inspect an old lead mine on Chats Island.
The terms of sale in this matter most fair and honorable to both parties.
The gentlemen who have purchased not speculators, but bona fide miners, who will work the properly for what it contains of zinc, lead and silver, and consequently have been careful to not bind themselves to the payment of thousands of dollars at once, without having plenty of time to develop the property and satisfy themselves that they are getting value for their money, while on the other hand the Messrs. Lawn have made a most fair and business like arrangement whereby they share a certain percentage of the output, receiving besidea instalments on the pur-1 chase price at stated intervals. When the	¦
purchasers arc satisfied as to the quantity j 2H021 uO of ore being abundant they are at liberty to pay any balance of the purchase price then unpaid, and then the Messrs Lawn’s percentage ceases Work is to begin within three months and proceed contin uoualy. The purchase p runs well up into the five figures. The Messrs. Lawn deserve credit for the concessions they have made to induce these gentlemen to invest in mining property in this vicinity, and to secure g ing operations being under!ak ried on by men of large capital, which will give employment to a considerable number of hands within the next few months.
It may be mentioned that the Russell Mine is not included in the deal.
To Mr. R. McC. Ritchie, through whose instrumentality the deal was sum mated, the community owe a debt of gratitude for the untiring energy with which he has labored to bring the parties together. We congratulate our friend on the successful issue of his labors and trust that he will receive a. handsome pecuniary benefit as a reward for his services.

The warriors whom the Mad Moullah has gathered round him belong to the Swat Valley and fiajaur, and are reputed among the fiercest fighters on the Indian border. The inferiority of their arms and their lack of artillery, however, always tell against them, and unless they have received from some quarter better weapons than those with which they met the British troops during the last campaign, when their country was annexed two years ago. their defeat is a foregone conclusion. What gives importance to this rising on the road to Chit-rel in the north, is that it coincides with the outbreak in the Toohi Valley the western frontier, and with the
