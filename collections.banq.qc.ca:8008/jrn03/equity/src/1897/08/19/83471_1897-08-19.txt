QoodLerhm Distillery to Shut Down
AT
Toronto, Aug. 12.—There will be no new whiskey turned out from Gooderham distillery this w nter. There is enough on hand already to last some time, and manufacture will be stopped for a while. This will seriously affect farmers and cattle shippers around Toronto. Large quantities of grain used in manufacturing whiskey when the distillery is in full swing makes it an excellent market for farmers, who with good crops have been looking forward to good times. The hay market in Toronto will suffer most, perhaps, though indirectly. It is the custom of all the large distilleries to dispose of the used grain, or “slops,” to cat tie dealers, shippers, etc., who depend to a considerable extent to this source for feed. The “slops” from the Gooderham
