Card of Thanks.—The widow and brothers of the deceased James Dagg desire, through these columns, to express their sincere thanks to the numerous friends in Bristol and Clarendon for the many acts of kindness extended towards them,during the illness and death of their late lamented relative.
A violent storm visited the neighborhood of Billerica on Friday last. Rain fell in torrents, and buildings, trees and telegraph poles were blown down by the high wind which swept over a stretch of country about half a mile in width. Fences were knocked down and a greal deal of corn and grain destroyed.
To The Equity.
I wish to thank the neighbors and friends who showed their love and assistance in attending to my daughter and in trying to comfort her during her sickness; and I pray to God to add His blessing to each and to all for their labor of love and kindness to her through all her illness. She passed away in my arms to her heavenly home, in full assurance of being forever with the Lord.

Rev. J. M. Coffin,of Bristol, has had the pleasure of a visit from an elder brother who resides in St Johns, Newfoundland, where he is connected with one of the large educational institutions of that col ony. Both gentlemen visited Shaw ville on Friday last, and among other places ghve The Equity a call. Mr. Coffin is one of those who is of opinion that it would be to the advantage of Newfound land to come into the Canadian Confederation, and expresses the belief that such will be its ultimate destiny. The condition of affairs in the Island, which for some time past has been very unsatiefac tory, has began to show signs of material improvement, and while there exists several impediments to its progress and development,—such as the French Shore n™
, for example—the prospects for
___ prosperous future are gradually
growing brighter. The infusion of the new blood into the administration of the affairs of the Island which would follow ,, Confederation with the Dominion, Mr.	P
Coffin thinks, would have a decidedly beneficial effect.	pe^#

The directors of the Central Canada Fair have spared no expense to make the Ottawa exhibition this year the best in the history of the ssaoeiation. The prize list of the exhibition totals $15,000 and in addition forty five gold medals as special prizes. In the horse department alone eighteen gold medals are offered as specials. There are eight in the cattle class. Farmers will find it to their advantage to exhibit-at thia year’s show. There will be a choice program of special ties and the grand spectacular “The Taking of the Bastille” has been arranged for the amusement of visitors.

Had she lived until the 17th of September, proximo, she would have completed year of her life. But, in the dispensation of an AU'wise Providence, such was not to be. About two years ago the germs of that treacherous disease, consumption, entered her system, and imprinted Death's seal upon her bright young life. Despite
