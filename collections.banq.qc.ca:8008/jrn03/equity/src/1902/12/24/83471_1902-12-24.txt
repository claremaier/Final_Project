There is nn ol«l Haying that If the 'first Snndiiy of a month is rainy, jevery Hundiiy In that month will uImi lie rainy. The Fame rule, In popular estimation, should appty to ¦other «lays of the week, end without regard to their place in the month. This if* merely a convenient way ol saying that the weather tends to repent itself about once in seven day», flie comlitiorH prevailing un Sunday lire more cloudy observed anti hot-iter remembered because of tho 11rcui which Sunday makes in tho roguhu pursuits of the week.

EARNED A TITLE
SMALLEST SAILING VESSEL
that ever made tho voyage from Canada to South Africa. Tho Sea j$uc7 Canal Gull was built in Oakville in 1807 by the Simpsons, who built the Oriole and other well known vessels.
The Sea Gull was a brigantine of only 400 tons burden. A brigantine, it may be explained for thc benefit of tho uninitiated, is a craft rigged with square sails upon tho foremast and a foie und aft sail on tho mainmast. Tho Jessie Drummond, which on hcr ocean voyage was a borken-tine, carried square sails upon lier foremost and fore-and-aft sails upon her main and mi/Evn masts.
The Fca Gull spent two or three
Lading
and then departed for Natal, South Africa, with a wonderful assortment of merchandise in her hold. Tho Sea Gull made the voyage in safety.
Nothing remarkable happening upon tho trip, though thc journey revealed tlio fact that the Sea Gull was ji little top heavy in rig for ocean work, so at the Natal port her sticks were shortened by eight feet.
When she returned to Toronto a year after she was n subject of much curiosity as she lay nt the foot of Y rage street, and was visited by thousands of citizen». Doth brothers were presented with gold watches by tho citizens of Toronto as tokens of appreciation of their achievements on tho briny ocean.
Tho Sea Gull, after a career as a sailing vessel, was sold to Oswego, where she was transformed into a barge. After doing duty on this lake for some years she was.sent to the upper lakes, where she ended her career in a blaze ÙÎ fire at East Ta was, on Lake Michigan.

And Mr. McDonald has good reason for the stand lie takes.
While at work in the coal pits he strained his back and was sent home in un agony of pain, doctor, twenty-five miles away, was sent for, but lie could do little to relievo his buffering. This was in October, 1901, and he couldn't do a hand’s turn of work till the spring of 1902.
