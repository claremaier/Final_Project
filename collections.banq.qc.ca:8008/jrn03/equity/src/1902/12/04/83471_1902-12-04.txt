P., for Lennox, who left e sick bed in order to testify for the defence, gave a firm den si t) the charge that Mr. Cars-cellen had given one Wilekin, ef Bath, SI 60 to influence the letter's vote. Mr. Wile on swore that he was present at the lime that the money was paid openly as a legitimate expenditure. Mr. Cereosllen, the respondent, was on the witness stand for a good part of the day and denied the chargee made agatnet him. He also declared emphatically that throughout the whale campeign he knew of no money having been spent corruptly in the Conservative interest.

The Winnipeg Tribute, one of the Liberal Journals in Canada to remember and support the best traditions of the party, pays Mr. R. L. Borden, the Conservative leader, a high tribute, and incidentally denounces Hon. Clifford Sift on as a political traitor. In a recent issue it said editorially :

avoid forcing discredit on present leaders | Sov. 15th. 1902 •of (ha Liberal paity.
When the scheme wai broached for the construction of the Canadian Pacific, the 3-iberal party, led by Hon. Edward Blake, vainly sought to have the line pass thro’
American territory.	,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier was one of the loud-ot champions of United States interests.
He declared, 4t If this contract is to be judged in the light of modern British ideas and principles, it carries with it its deith warrant, and the only duty that Tematufl for the House to perform is simply to reje.t it on the first Opporlunity.”
Asa substitute for an all Canadian line, he advocated a railway te Sault Ste Marie theoce by the Northern Pacific through foreign territory to the Canadian Weet.
Sit Richard Cartwright was of the tame opinion. He was certain that “ the confounded Pacific Riilway was likely to be the death of half a dozen ministers before It was through with." This was hie fcnwsge to the Canadian Parliament and the Canadian people.
But when it came to a question of foadding a feeder to a United States line,
Sir Richard, like Sir Wilfrid, was enthusiastic.
During the coming session of Parlia ment both ministers will have an oppor tunifcy to duplicate their opposition of £880. Another " confounded Pacific (Railway*' will again engage the attention c\ all Canadians. Will the present lead-*11 oppose it as they did the “ Canadian Pacific " ? Will they dare to stand before the people of thiacountry And advocate the expenditure of money for the benefit of foreign vailroadrf? Will they again de moance the West as a waste—• land of hills and lakee-the tradio of which -would not pay for the grease of the wheels.
These are things not to be recalled, now that our Welt is a by-word among nations.

He makes a sign to Acjmied, who knows the Interview is at an < once more leads the way along the palace foundations, with the Intention of reaching the wall at the point where the friendly hope hangs.
Jack has a doze# things upon hte mind, and Is endeavouring to solve a certain puzzle, when something happens to arouse him. The Siberian wolf-dags burst out Into so fierce a clamour that one can almost Imagine they have slipped the leash, and are running loose. This sound gives Jack a •tart, and he glances up, to see Achmed trembling Just in front, as though he has looked upon a ghost.

The American do** not restrain the cry that bubbles to tile lips—he recognizes that voice, and yet can hardly believe his senses. . Those soft tones he listened to In the llower mart of Barcelona, again while the nun from Geroua bent over his wounded form, then at the bull-fight in Madrid, and later when the train stopped at the station, and the seeming peasant bey warned him of the danger beyond Logrono. Yes, it is, Indeed, Mercedes, but what in the name of Heaven does the Spanish beauty here—he has fondly believed she s'dil searches Paris for him. |
A terrible suspicion flashes into his mind—can the pasha have arrived ahead of time ? Almost on the instant he dismisses it—such a thing Is impossible—Mercedes was not detained In Paris like the pasha, and there has really been nothing to prevent her following them in some clever disguise.

Jack believes he knows the Spanish character well—revenge comes into the life of most people who live under Southern skies, and she—Mercedes— has sacrificed herself in order to get even .with the man she worships, but who can find no love for her in return.
What will she do ? She Is here as the representative of the pasha, and has his hatred for Doctor Jack to look after as well as her own feelings in the matter.
Shaking off the dreadful clutch of that dumb monster, fear, Jack addressee the other—he must know the worst.
Jack has little to say as they trudge back again to the busy haunts of Stamboul, but he does the biggest kind of thinking, arranging the many little details so necessary to his plans. Larry must, of course, be taken Into his confidence. He believes the dude has been having a good time all day, and will be ready to stand by him on the night when Aleck's rescue Is to be attempted.
