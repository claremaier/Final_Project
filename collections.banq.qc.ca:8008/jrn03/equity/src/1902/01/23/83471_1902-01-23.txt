CHAPTER l
/,
Canada haw never had much trouble with lier Indians. They arc peaceable, large numbers oi them being civilized or semi-civilized. They are almost wholly self-supporting, and perform much hard and useful labor. Vet lho Canadian Government has never done, and is not doing now, anywho. u near so much for them as thô United States does for its copper-skinned wards. Perhaps the difference is largely due to the fact that tho Canadians have never had to deal with tho fiercer tribes and that the total number of Indians in Canada is not large, says a writer in tho Minneapolis Journal.
%he Canadian reservation system with utterly unlike ours. Instead of setting aside vast tracts of contiguous hind they give each group of Indians here and there, a lew hundred or thousand acres of land.

Reliability 1
There is nothing on the face of the earth in which it is easier to be deceived than in jewellery. The public know nothing about jewellery and just as liable to buy a poor as a good article if left to themselves. Their only safeguard is to buy from a reliable jeweller to whom they can return the goods if not satisfactory. Don’t be deceived by the shine of the article and remember that one sells good dollars for 75 cents.
