They travelled up second-class, having a compartment to themselves. Both doors were locked, the govenj mounted guard at one, Mr. Goody «ha Other. Leon sat between them, cool and comfortable, in n light suit of "dittoes” which ho had worn the journey from Paris, and looking, but for the manacled hands, like an ordinary passenger. No incident of any importance occurred on the journey up. Captain Scrooby never relaxed his vigilance. He sat bolt upright at his window with hie eye constantly fixed on his prisoner. This window on the platform side was hermetically closed, so that none of tho occupants of the carriage could have any knowledge of what took place at the few stations at which they had stopped on the road.
Captain Scrooby was quite unconscious, therefore, that the train had been invaded at Basingstoke by a small mob of roughs. The firr.t Intimation ho had of the fact was at Vnuxhull, where they alighted with him and his party. Had he realized who they were, or their intentions, he would certainly have gone on to Waterloo.
But to understand the movements of this little hand it is necessary to follow tho letter despatched clandestinely by I .con to Mcggitt.
Meggitt had understood on receiving it that whatever he did he must do at once.
But .the more he thought it over the more he realized his own helpless n -s»

"It won't be so easy,” said that ( stoiid-looking matron, "but it is a rare chance, and it tintst be tried. 1 will call Joe Magsman,”—an evillooking individual, who said—
"Wo can get him fust enough ; the thing will be to keep him or help him away.”
"But bow will you get him ?" asked Mcggitt. "it will to broad daylight and he is sure to be well guard-
