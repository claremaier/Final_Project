In selecting beef that the grain is smooth open, that tho fibre parts or breaks readily when pressed by tho finger, that tho color is a deep rose, and that tho fat is a rich cream color. White fat i» an Indication of young beef lacking in flavor, and a deep yellow shows ihatggg^g tough and of Inferior quality.
All meats are better flavored and more nutritious when cooked without removing nil of the bones. To prepare for roasting, wipe oiT the meat with a wot cloth, place it on the rack of tho pan, if you have one, pour in a pint of water and place in the oven. Tho oven should bo hot the first 10 or 15 minutes to shut in tho Juices. The heat forms n crust by hardening the albumen. Then tho heat should be lowered and the cooking proceed slowly. Tho time required to roast beef is from 10 to 20 minutes to tho pound, cording as the meat Is to bo done, medium or rare. Baste every 10 or 15 minutes, and a few minutes before serving remove the meat to n warm oven, if gravy is to be made.
