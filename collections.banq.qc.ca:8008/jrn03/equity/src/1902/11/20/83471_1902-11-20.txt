The xvearlsome journey draws near \n end, nml with the morning they Md lhenmtdvrÿ close to their goal, iroat Inroads have been made in the »ld time habita of the Turks by the )regress of civilisation rushing eastward. The advent of the railroad has •hanged many of their customs, and iomo of the most intelligent among the officials would follow after the * ays of their Western neighbours If he mass of people were not so set-led In their old dogmas.
Gradually the Turk is being pushed tut of Europe—many of his fairest provinces have been taken away and nadc Into nexv status that, formerly 1 coalition, will put a nation between Austria and the Black Sea.
Some day there will l>e an upheaval, ind Mr. Turk will cross the Bosphor-¦« in a hurry, to return no more, wh< n Constantinople, taken originally by hours before he can receive hls reply, oree, will revert to new owners, Thc he asks th - operator, a Frenchman, I'urk is nothing if not philosophical, to hold it for him, after which he 1 mi when this ful day of dieast »r comes he will probably say, resign >dly ” Kismet

It may be set down fur granted that Jr.ck has Ills hands full, but hr Is feeling like a lighting cock, and was never better tn hls life, so If he falls, he cannot offer as an excuse that he was nut In condition.
Two days and nights—that Is the mort le can count on ere Abdallah Pasha turns up- perhaps even now the Turk Is on tho way, driving fast as a European train can take 1dm for the city on tlie Bosphorus, eager to thwart tho schemes of hls shrewd Yinkee enemy.
Jack’s first desire Is to find this out — there is a telegraph lino to Paris, and he seeks the Hotel de lx>ndres In l era. where he sends a message to the prefect cf police, carefully worded, and desires un answer.
Then, knowing that it will be some

Jack asks more questions, and so mo
and hurries « ch.tflMH
ramiters away.
The Turks are accustomed to seeing Franks in all places, and derive much Income from them, so that they pay no attention to them so long us they saunter about.
Hence Jack Is/or» wire to rush along, no matter what eagerness he may :•»* mtraining, but makes up for this by peristenre, so that he gets there ull the same,
l eaving "Peia, he makes enquiries, and finally enters tho shop of an armorer In a bazaar. The man looks at him closely giver n cry of " Allah Is great ! It Is my master." and kisses bis hand Impulsively.
This Turk is a man whom Doctor
Allah is Allah, ind Mohammed is his prophet."
At a quarter to ten Jack calls their mention to a sight that Inspires them nto a burst of enthusiasm has climbed half way up In the heavens. and ns they chance to be upon m elevation where they van see the >!ue waters of the Bosphorus, before their vision comes a glimpse of Constantinople a ill they forget that first view of the Oriental city

Soon the train reaches the station Jack having been here before, kn ;he ropes, and pilots hls party by m ans of what seems to be an underground railway into the city proper.

Hotels are almost an unknown luxury In Turkey, and what inps there tie European visitors avoid as a rencral thing, seeking some private bouse to which they have been referred by friends who have been here before.

That Mr. R. L Borden, the leader of the Conservative parly, means ju*t what he says is established by this s‘a*sment Nov. lotu, 1908 of his made in a recent speech, in which | —¦ he explained his attitude on the Chinese question,
“ That, practically speaking, is the stand I took in British Columbia, and j* is the stand I am prepared to take any whera ; and I recall at the moment that the Minister of Justice, the other day, was good enough to say that in advancing such a statement I was saying what I did not believe. I would thank my fr end thç >lin’8 er of Justice not to apply Li • and methods to Conservatives. There aeoms to be a great doubt amongst the Libera’s as to what their leaders do mean.
1 mean exactly what I said to the people of British Columbia, and I made the a atement to the people there after considering the subject fairly and carefully, and I said to the penffie of British Columbia that so far as the Conservative po icy > was concerned 1 was not going to te 1 them I would test the voice of the Conservatives of British Columbia but that it was a subject upon which the rest of Canids should consult the wishes of Brit ish Columbia, and when the wishes of the people there were once definitely stated the Conservative government would be prepared to carry that out by every means in their power—carry out the wishes, not of the Conservatives of British Columbia or of the Liberal*! but the wishes of the whole people."

in the city a few days ago Mr. Tarte is •a d to have exclaimed “things art coming my way, " and it is evident the political criiia is only in its inception. Quebec, the great stronghold of Liberal ism is dissatisfied with the turn affair» have taken, and should there be an election tomorrow, its verdict from all reports, would be in marked contrast to that of two years ago. The spirit of faction in the party councils of which Mr. Tarte speaks in La Patrie, and which has been evidenced in other quarters very much of late, is growing and the breach is widening. Taking the big department of public works from Quebec is aiding fuel to the flame.

Last Wednesday's Ottawa Citizen says: The French Canadian! in Ottawa, aeeUe-where, are by no means pleased with the cabinet reconstruction, inasmuch as
takes from the hands of the MM vlnce of Quebec, one of the largest spending departments in the whole administra lion. They olaim that the province is not getting its fair share, and that its prestige in the councils of the country stands to be lowered. It is pointed out thet the three French speaking ministers Sir Wilfried Laurier, Hon. Mr. Bernier and don. Mr. Prefon sine, preside over departments in which the expenditures partively eras’l, while all the ig game goes to Ontario or «orne other province. The French Canadians arc sticklers when it cornea to a question of
rights, and their dissatisfaction over the
preerat shuffle is not concealed, neither is is confined to any one party. nen
