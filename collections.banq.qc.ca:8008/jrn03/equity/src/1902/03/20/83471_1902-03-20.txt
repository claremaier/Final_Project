GOOD RECIPES.
Veal OmeletteóTake four pounds shoulder or other cheap parts of tho veal, Bono and chop line. Then take 16 crackers rolled and sifted, 4 eggs wall beaten, pepper and salt to suit tho taste. Mix all well together. Pack tightly into a loaf, lay iu a pan and pour around it 2 cups boiling water, llasto two or throe Him*. Bako an hour. Try with a ªtrnw. Very nice for picnics, Sunday dinners, etc.
Roast ReefóPrepare for the oven by <rcdging lightly with flour and evasonhig with salt and pepper ; place in tho oven, and basic frequently while roasting. Allow a quarter of an hour for a pound of meat, if you like it rare, longer if you like it well done. Serve with a sauce made from the drippings in the pan, to which has been added 1 tablespoon tomato capsup.
SoupóFour pounds shin of beef, or 4 lbs knuckle of veal, or 2 lbs of each; 2 Æz butter, 2 large onions, 1 turnip, 3 carrots, 1 head celery, 3 lumps sugar, 2 oz salt, & teaspoon whole poppers, 1 large blade mace, 1 bunch savory herbs, 4 qts and $ pt cold water. Cut up the meat into pieces about throe inches square; rub the butter on the bottom of the stew pan, and put in $ pt water, the meat and all tho other ingredients. Cover the stewpan and place in a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents. When tho bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale jelly-like substance, add the 4qts cold water and simmer very gently. Remove every particle of scum while t is boding.
Tip-Top PuddingóTwo cups buttermilk, 2 cups flour or Indian meal (1 prefer the meal), 1 cup beef suet chopped, 1 cup dried currants, * cup sugar, 2 eggs, beaten separately 1 teaspoon soda, 1 teaspoon salt, spices if you prefer. Steam for three hours in a pudding form. Eat hot with cream and sugar.
Grafton biscuitóPour 1 qt boiling milk over * Tb lard and a little salt. Stir in 4 tablespoons flour. Let the mixture cool, then add flour sufficient to make a stiff sponge and 1 teacup yeast, also 2 tablespoons sugar. Let rise live hours. Make up soft, and knead as bread. When light again, roll out into sheets three-fourths of an inch thick; cut into round cakes, set these closely in a pan, let them rise for half an hour, and bake 20 minutes in a quick oven. They are tho best rolls I ever nto.
GingerbreadóHalf a teacup molasses, i teacup buttermilk, 1 beaten egg, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 level teaspoon each of ginger and soda sifted with 2 teacups flour. Bake in a sheet, not as a loaf.

vailed in the universities was immoral. Students should not bo ashamed to oppose it, but should make it a point to do so. Drinking is not a manly sport, and does not Imply anything honorable or useful, and the custom of trying to drink down oneís neighbors is unworthy of German students; it ought to bo left to drinkers of schnapps, who often sacrifice their lives in these foolish contests. Above all, students should nÙt drink until their dayís work is finished, since it had been scientifically proved that even small quantities of intoxicating drink diminished tho powers of attention of the brain. The professors further invito the students to abolish tho almost universal custom of ìFruhschoppcn,î or morning beer drinking.
An interesting side-light upon tho nutritive values of different kinds of food is furnished by an editorial in tho London Lancet treating of the quantity of water to bo found in many well-known articles of human diet. It appears, for example, that tho turnip contains over DO per cent, of water, tho cabbage nearly the Bame amount, ami the cucumber and the vegetable marrow about 95 per cent.; whilst amongst fruits the strawberry contains nearly 90 per cent. of water, the apple 82 per cent., and grapes 80 per cent. Even tho various meats used as food contain an amount of water far in ex-cess of tho amount of solid constituents. Thus three-fourths of beef and mutton consist of water. Lamb contains less water, namely, 64 per cent., pork still less, 60.9 per cent, and bacon only 22.3 per cent. It would appear that ns the flesh foods Increase in the amount of fat, the proportion of water, as a rule, diminishes. Coming to birds, the flesh of the fowl and duck contains about 70 per cent, of watcj\ and that, of tho pigeon 75 pier cent, while the flesh of the goose contains only 88 per cent., the last being another example of the fat increasing with a corresponding diminution in the proportion of water. Fishes contain from 40 to 80 per cent, of water.
The egg, one of the most powerful of nutritives, contains 65.5 per cent, of water, the white consisting of 80 per cent., and the yolk of 50.9 per cent. The latter, of course, is the more nourishing part. As a rule, foods containing a small proportion I doctor with his hoofs.

A marvellous feat in the hunting field was reported tv few months since from Warrnnmbool, Victoria. During a run of the local hounds a horse known ns Handy Andy, ridden by Mr. M. J. Dickson, approached a stiff four-rail fence in the neighborhood of Grasmere. Another horse, bearing Dr. MncKnight, stopped within a few feet of the obstacle, and running down the fence, got in the way of Handy Andy. The latter then jumped the obstructing horse, rider and fence, just,touching the
PLAGUE OF WILD DOGS.
In Northern Patagonia a reward is offered for tho extermination of the dogs mat overrun that part of the world. The ancestors of these wild dogs were a pair of tame collies which were taken over by a Scotsman straight from his native heath. The animals have retained their natural instinct in connection with sheep, but instead of guarding them they prefer killing them; hence the farmers have always to be prepared for the sudden advance at any time of a strong herd of the wild creatures hungering after mutton.
That overcoats arc responsible for many colds has long been suspected.

In her own mind she laughed at all pathetic stories. Riches, honor, title, with her ranked before love. She thought but little of it. She had no sweet, girlish dream of something to come which should brighten her life and change it. Rut her heart was waking. She had fanned to herself a marriage with Philip Lisle, but love had no part in the plan.
Her heart was waking from its long dream of vanity and coldness. Philipís face haunted her. She could not forget it. His voice sounded ever in her earsóso gay, so generous, chivalrous and noble. Who was like him ? No false or mean word over stained his lipsóno selfish thought ever camo near him. He was not handsome as an Apollo, or gifted with the keenest intellect ; hut his kindly, comely face had all tho charm of truth and nobility. One felt instinctively on looking at him, that ho was a man in whose hands honor and life might safely bo trusted; and withal, ho had a high-bred, degogo manner that fascinated all who approached him.
Tho time came to Rita when the name of Philip Lb le sounded like sweetest music in her earsóearth hold none sweeter ; when to be near him. to hear him talk, to feel his admiring glance upon her, was the keenest pleasure earth could give herókeener far than the happiness that she found in wealth and honor. Sho began to study him, to lay herself out to please him ; tho proud face softened for him, the haughty lips, gave him smiles and words no other ever received. It was a wonderful loveówonderful from its concentration. She had no other thought, no other idea. To have won him she would have laid down her life. Such a love might have been the redemption of another woman ; in that grand, erring, ambitious nature it was but another source of destruction.
Philip admired his cousin thought her wonderfully beautiful and most wonderfully proud. He was kind and affectionate to her. after tho mntmer of an older brother; but as to love, he never gave it a thoughtóit never occurred to him to fall in love with Lord Lisle's daugh-
The your passed rapidly enough.
At, its close Margaret was barely recognizable. All that Civilization could do for her was done. All trace of tho cottage education had disappeared; the musical voice had bo-cleui and distinct as a silver bell; all little eccentricities of speech and manner had disappeared ; her language, even, had become remarkable for its elegant simplicity and force.
Tho half-conscious manner had disappeared, and a graceful dignity had taken its place. Margaret had spared ne pains. She read, and, above all, listened to the conversation of clever ac.4 talented men. Sho was so quick, so apt in all imitation, that nothing escaped her. The names of great men and great works were no longer a dead letter to her ; she could converse intelligently and well. Her wonderful beauty hud been carefully cultivated also. Few would ha\o recognized In tho queenly girl, whose magnificent face drew all eyes, tho rustic beauty who had listened an eagerly to Ralph Ashtonís praises.
Ford Lisle was more than satisfied with that ono yearís training.
News came often from England.
Mrs. Wytorno found plenty to do in managing the Hall. Philip was busily engaged in tho care of the estate.
Lord Lisle wrote, pressing him to join them at Rome, and spend some months with them.
"Do come, Philip," ho wrote. "1 want you to see what progress Rita has made. I want to know what you think of her."
They went ï to 'Naples and from there Lord Lisle wrote a most kind letter to Daisy, pressing her to pay them a visit.
"1 want you to live with us," ho to he as one of my own ; to be Rita's sister, as you always been. Como and stay
and
then wo can decide about tho future."
And Daisy, in reply, said that in two months tho term for which she had engaged herself to tho Denhams would expire, and then sho would gladly rejoin her sister. Philip's letter reached Naples the same morning saying he should be with them during that week.
He cuino one beautiful evening, when the sky was cloudless, and the waters of tho bay, half blue golden, rippled and broke musically upon tho shore. Lord Lisle had gone out, an4 Mrs. Marche was engaged when he arrived. Ho was ushered into a room that seemed to be all sunlight and flowers. He saw there a dignified and beautiful woman, who

Lord Lisle never mentioned that little scene. On his daughterís face when they next met, there was no sign of love.
