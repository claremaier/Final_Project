Supplement to The Equity.
20th Yean.
Shawville, Que., Wednesday, June 25,1902.
No. 2.
Tho circulation of dirty bills of small denominations and the need for reform was a subject taken up by the Montreal Board of Trade Council yesterday after-V* mx*, says list Thursday’s Star. The Council has been making an effort to induce the Government to put into circula lion clean Dominion notes, and with that end in view, communicated with the bankers' section of the board. From tho secretary of that institution, the following letter was read :
As already reported to Mr. Hoe, the banks’ representative on the Board of Trade, the Deputy Minister of Finance has assured thin association that his department will be prepared to fill all orders for small legal tender notes during the coming summer. An adequate supply of clean bills by tho Government ought to remove all cause of complaint on the part of the public, as the chartered banks cannot fairly be charged with issuing dirty notes. Of course, the banks cannot compel the holders of money until for circulation to present them for redemption, and it frequently happens that, notes remain in circulation long after they are unlit for use.
The council considered this result of its efforts combined with those of the Bankers' Association, had resulted satisfactorily, as it appeared, that before lung the Government hills, which were by far the worst, would be replaced by clean ones.

Toronto, June 10 —Alfred Jury, Dominion emigrant agent at Liverpool, ha a arrived in the city, his old home, after absence of about five years, Air. Jury predicts that the emigration to Canada this year will exceed in point of numbers that of any year in the past decade. The temper of the British populace, towards Canada, Mr. Jury says, is one of great enthusiasm, and no special effort will be needed to turn this good feeling commercial channels that will result in the eatabliahment of such relatii wtl keep Canada in the lead for a quarter * ' of a century. “The feeling in England towards this country, ” Mr. Jury says, “ is not nearly a spasm of patrotric enthusiasm over the valorous conduct of Canada's troops in South Africa. It is not wholly a question of sentiment. Canada's preferential tariff in favor of England has made a deep impression upon the commercial leaders of the empire They
