PREPARE FOR THE HAY HARVEST.
Haying & Harvesting Tools
The success of the Massey-Harris Mower is due to its possessing the following special advantages:
First of all—Quality.
Folding Bar, operated automatically by coil spring.
Adjustable Whiffletrees.
Largest range of Tilt of any Mower made.
À wide Rake with a Frame that will not sag.
The acquisition of tho plant and equipment of the Pontiac Telephone Company, by its big brother the Poll Company, while it may have it* advantages in swm? respect*, will have iis drawbacks in I * others, so that after all it ii difficult to discern at the moment whether or not the county has gained anything by the transaction. I nder the several managements who operated the old system, subscribers had the advantage of phone connection with every portion of the county, where the system extended, at an upset price of §12 per annum. The new management has materially altered that condition of things, inasmuch as the service has been limited to each particular business centre and the phone rate raised as well. Communication with neighboring villages, now entails an extra charge upon the person who desires to use tn service, a regulation which very few willing to submit to, while the purely local service is not considered to l>e worth the money demanded for it. The result is that a,'very appie:i»ble shrinkage is likely to take place in tho list of subscribers, . and this will naturally affect the value of | p, s. Hay Forks, the system to those who continue to use it. The Bell Company were all right in rasing the rates, but they put their foot in it badly in circumscribing the service.

A NEWLY REBUILT HILL !
Mr. Murray, our Pembroke representative in the House of Commons, present at the celebration at Bryson Wednesday last, and embraced the opportunity to express a word of thanks to the electors and incidentally to tell them of all the things he was accomplishing for hitherto poor old neglected Pontiac ! Among other things Mr. M. expressed himself opposed to any change in the existing railway route, and that no change would be made if he could prevent it. In making a statement of this nature, Mr. M. must have counted the existence uf considerable virtue in a little cheap, political clap trap, as that gentleman as well as everybody else knows that when the C. P. R has lieen invested with powers which enable it do precisely as it desires, (as in this particular in stance) Mr. Murray's opposition would bo decidedly of the feather weight variety if pitted against the avowed intentions of that gigantic organization, if those intentions are at variance with Mr. Murray’s views as expressed at Bryson.
< >ur impression is that the C.P. R will make its connection just where it suits the company—without being guided by the opinions or influenced by the objections vf anyone. If that point should be at Chalk River, Mr. Murray will be careful to have the people of the western vml of the county understand that he had Hometiling to do with it; and if on the other hand the junction should be at or vast of Pem bioke, tho member for Pontiac will afford those t-ion of his righteou-then wink th to Pembroke centred.

When, us a lad of 20, and Prince of Wales, King Edward Vll. visited St Louis, Mo., the annual fair was mi there. A large amphitheatre seated 25,000 peoi le. The show ring ineide tie amphitheatre was between an eighth ami a quarter of a mile in length. The stock of horses and cattle on exhibition was exceptionally good. Horses came to compete for the premiums from every State in the Union. The Prince took great interest in the stock, and examined it carefully.
A premium of St,000 was offered for the best harness stallion, free for all in the United States. It was the first $1,000
for horses in that country, and the competition was exciting.
Forty-seven horses were entered and showed for the prize. Among the number were Flying Cloud. Stock bridge Chief. Quicks! her, and Silver Heels, all sired by Vermont Black Hawk.

AS THE N1GIIT WANED AWAY they heard the rushing of waters, and being ignorant of the direction in which they had been going during the night, they reasoned that they must have been driven back upon the shores of the north German ocean. Instead of that they were over the waters of the Rhine, not far from Coblentz. At 5.10 o’clock n. m. they were at their greatest altitude, about two and a quarter miles.	'
In the early morning light objects 150 miles distant could be seen from this altitude. At 6.15 o’clock a. m. they beheld the sunrise, but in a few moments the balloon descended to a lower level nnd darkness again surrounded	them. Three
times they saw the sun rise and set twice before daylight became permanent. As soon as* the mist that followed had cleared away, they prepared to descend.
They found themselves in the t0 ' ducy of Nassau, about 6 miles from Wcitburg and nearly 600 miles from home.
