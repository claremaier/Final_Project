It is therefore, quite obvious that, to convert the food taken into the stomach into real muscle-food, there must be air to combine with It. The air, in fact, supplies to the muscle-food the very same factor as the saltpetre supplies to the gunpowder. If carbon end sulphur are mixed, although they have potential force, that force cannot bo brought into action without tho aid of salt-pet re. And the virtue of saltpetre lies in the fact that it contains a largo quantity of oxygen.
This Is why air is mo essential to life. There can bo no action without it. Our heart, which is itself & very powerful muscle, could not beat very powerful muscle, could not beat, could not convey messages

PA’S IGNORANCE.
Most every day when I'm at school The teacher tells us thing*
About the birds aud animals And the president* aud kings.
And then at night, when 1 ask pa If what she says 1* so,
He reads hi* paper right along And says, “Oh, 1 dumio!"
One day sho told us that the world Is round, just tike a ball,
And that there's nothing down below It's standing on at ail.
I ost pa If she told tike truth,
He rend bln paper through,
And put hi* feet upon a chair,
And sild—"Ob, 1 dunuv!"
And once the teacher aald the sky Ain't heaven's floor, aud tried To make us think no angels walk Along the other Hide,
And so that night I ast my pa.
And all he said was -"Oh,
Don't bother me about such things, I’m busy—I dunnol"
I used to kind of think somehow That my pa knew a lot—
But that was wrong, or If he did 1 guoma that he's forgot.
Since I’ve got started Into school, Most every day or ho I hear about a hundred thlugs Pa doesn't seem to know.

Ships sail over these mountains of the seu as eagloa pass over the Alps, hut owing to the darkness that reigns in tho ocean depths, wo cannot look down and soc their peaks, slopes and ranges lying far beneath tho keels of our vessels. But we can discover them by feeling, as it were; that is to say, by means of soundings that reveal their outlines. One of the remarkable chains of submarine mountains discovered in this manner lies about a hundred miles east of the coast of Australia. It was found in surveying a track for a cable to Norfolk Island. The sea over the tops of its highest summits is about 1,500 feet deep, but around them tho plummet sinks to a depth of two or three miles.

Among the symptoms by which indigestion in infants and young children-may be readily recognized are loss of appetite, nausea, eructations, coated tongue, bad breath, hiccough, and disturbed sleep. Indigestion may be easily cured, and Mrs. F. K. Bcgbie, Lindsay, Ont., points out how this may best be done. She says : "When my baby was three months old she had indigestion very badly.

Cured by Using Dr. Chase’s Nerve Food.
+-
To Jie awake night after night, the brain on fire with nervous excitement and thoughts flashing before the mind in never-ending variety, is the common experience of persons whose nerves arc weak and exhausted.
During such nights nerve force Is consumed at a tremendous rate.
Instead of being restored and reinvigorated for another day’s wear and tear tho body is further weakened and exhausted and the mind is unbalanced by this terrible waste of energy which the lamp of life is rapidly burning out.
It is in this despairing condition that many men and women attempt to drug and deaden the nerves by tiie use of opiates. This is a fatal step which hastens nerve decay.
Surely it Is wiser to build up and completely restore the nerves by using Dr. Chase’s Nerve Food, a treatment Which gets right down to the foundation of the difficulty mid effects permanent results by ravtfaU-izing the wasted nerve cells
Sleeplessness is only ono of the many distressing symptoms which entirely disappear with the Chase'a Nerve Food. It is a positive cure for Weakness of nerves and body, and is specific for woman's Ills because they almost invariably arise from exhausted serves. ÔU cts. a box, t> boxes for $2.00, at all dealarf
