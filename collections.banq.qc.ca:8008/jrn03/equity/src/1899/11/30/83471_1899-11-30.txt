It the Liberals remain in power they will probably prove to ho right in their prediction that Brit ain will not give Canada a preference over foreign countries, hut if the Couser vatives should obtain power and have an opportunity to carry on negotiations, there is reason to believe that Liberal prophecies will again be falsified by events.—M < *nt real Star.

Mr. Hardy, of Ontario, in his warm sympathy and cold justice speech, gave people to understand that while the Laurier Government reigned constituencies which elected its supporters to Par Lament would receive greatest consideration when public money was being distributed. Mr. Campbell, the Liberal representative of Kent, Ont., g>es Mr. Hardy one better. He has been advis ing that the Ottawa Government should starve Toronto until it sends to Parliament men who will support all that Tarte and Sifton and Blair do in Lauriers name.

The Toronto Globe having repeated for tho hundreth time that tho Laurier Government has been a doing government, whereas the Tory politicians constituted only a blowing concern, the Hamilton Spectator replies that the Globe is too modest, that the Laurier company is a blowing Government as well as a doing Government, that the troublais that that Government has been blowing one way and doing just tho opposite, and it gives a few instances as follows :
“ The Laurier gang blowed that it would reduce the cost of government sev eral millions, and when it came to doing it increased the coat by many millions.
“ It blowed that it would increase the population hugely, and several towns and cities have lost population, while none has had more than the natural home-produced increase.

The gang of 32 men from Aylmer, Hull, Gatineau Point and eurrouudiug country, who went north about four months ago to build a government road to Lake Bennett, has returned, having completed the work. The road built is 120 miles in length through a rough country, in which many natural difficulties had to be overcome. Only one of the party Xavier Damon tier, formerly of Hull, remained in the Yukon. Many of the party would have doi\e so, but they were 300 miles from Dawson City and being without ready means, were not in a position to cover the distance. They could not receive their wages till they returned to O.tawa, where they sign-led the contract.

A BOOK OF GREAT INTEREST has been published, or has just come to hitnd, which throws some light on that which is done, in Legislative Halls in Priuu* Edward Island. It is the acts of the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, and contains the congealed reflections of the administrators on their latest opportunity to make laws for a province which has powers uud privileges, even as our own, but is big enough to form three moderalesized counties.
The first matter to be noticed is the cheapness of everything in connection with tho Legislature of the Province.

It mny he objected, that to weigh animals periodically as indicated will consume time. It will take some time but all education takes time. Weighing the pigs will take some time, not necessarily very much, but it is time, which, in the end, will give a handsome return. At no period of the development of the animal will a weigh-scale be found more helpful than during the finishing season. It is easily possible to waste more food than would buy a net of scales within a very abort i*eriod when many animals are being fattened. At such a season the animals are, so to apeak, under pressure, and unless the machinery of digestion works smoothly and effectively, they may soon lake away with a large amount of food for which no adequate return is given these conditions the whole of the food given is not only lost, but the digestive capacity of the animal is also being Injured, for under the conditions

THE NEW WEDDING RING.
.Wedding rings are supposed to be
always the same, buit still the fashioin
of them has altered lately among the smart people. The newent brides are wearing plain gold circlets which are about two-thirds narrower than those formerly worn. When worn it is exactly like any conventional wedding ring. In reality it consists ot two separate gold bands, each made in a spiral. fThese fit so closely together as to form a perfect ring without visible joint. (This marriage ring is symbolical of the joining of two into one.

Have You Catarrh ?
If you are troubled with Catarrh and want to be cured, use Catarrho zone, which is a guaranteed cure for this distressing disease. There is no mystery about Catarrhozone, though its effect is magical. Ointments and snuffs cannot re icb the diseased parts and have thus proved useless, but Catarrhozone is carried by the air you breathe directly to the diseased parts, where it volatilizes, killing the germ life and healing the sore spots. It cures by inhalation. No danger, no risk, sold by all druggists or by mail, price $1.00. For trial outfit send 10c, in stamps to N. C. Poison & Co., Box 518 Kingston, Ont.
