A splendid fellow," thought the detective, mentally measuring hie inches,
"but who would have thought him coward enough to shoot an unarmed man ?"
^ Suddenly he stepped back, and through the folding-doors, looking around with a glance that embraced everything, especially the window that Jack had left open overnight, and which was open still. Beneath part of the roof of the dining-room, and beyond it, and a t’ ifle higher a large expanse of leads, bounded by the windowless backs of the houses in a by street that ran at right angles with the leads.
Window less ? Ay, but in the brick-tiled sloping roof of one of these houses the quick eye of Mr. Skewton detected a single skylight, shut, it is trte, but more than wide enough to admit the body of o man, while the diitp to the leads below was not more than twenty feet. " The window open, and a gkylight in another house by Which any one could get In here, and go all over the house," said Mr. Skew-ton to himself, "if it were not for the pistol, and this man’s damning evidence against himself—though he is too eager by half—I should say this might he a very interesting case indeed. Anyway,•' his eyes remained riveted to the skylight, "it won’t be such plain sailing as I supposed."
He had the more reason to believe himself correct In this supposition, when in the course of his travels round the room, he discovered and promptly annexed something that, however humble in itself, was destined to play an important part in the drama that had yet to be played out.

they could not otherwise obtain. The crimson clover also takes much nitrogen from the air, directly or indirectly. Now if the crimson clover crop is plowed under in the late fall or early spring, this great store of ui-tmgen and other plant food and vege-tatde mutter in the clover is added to the soil. For fertilizing purposes alone such n crop of crimson clover is estimated as being worth from #5 to as high as $20 per acre. Some levelheaded farmers who grow crimson clover on a large scale, maintain that l»y plowing under crimson clover no farmer ever need spend a cent for nitrogen and will only have to buy potash and phosphoric acid ms a fertilizer. The fact that this crimson clover can lie sown after early crops are removed in July and can be plowed under in time for planting the regular crops the next spring makes it indispensable wherever the soil requires fertilizers or humus, and this irrespective of whether the crimson clover stands the winter or not.

Whatever makes the feed taste better or makes it more enjoyable to the cow, increases its value for milk production. Early cut hay is best for the dairy cow not only because it contains more protein than that out late, but because its aroma and flavor make it more palatable to the cow. The appetising effect from the early cutting and careful curing of all forage crops, increases their feed value for milk production. Freshly harvested and freshly ground grain is the most palatable to the dairy cow, and will give best results. Dairymen who grind feed, should grind often, as grain that has lost its freshness is not the best relished by the cow.
Oft «a the dairyman has a large quantity of coarse, rather unpalatable fodders, such as corn fodder and over-ripe or slightly damaged hay, which he must feed, and has only a limited quantity of choice roughness to feed with it. in this case, best results

To wear your grandfather’s coat would not seem much of an honor, but to John Chinaman it is the greatest felicity. Not only is the common-look-shapeless blue blouse, of his ancestor prized because it is his ancestor’s. but because of its intrinsic value. The clothing usually worn by the Chief the purest silk, and costs anywhere from $100 to $250 a suit.
As a nation the Chinese object to wearing clothing of any other kind, and centuries of experiment have taught them how best to make up the
costly caterpillar thread into the most durable form. On this account the Chinese drees, though of purer material, has none of the sheen usually associated with silk, a peculiarity which has resulted in the erroneous ideas ae to their composition. All the garments are made in China, and are only exported for the personal of Celestials in foreign countries Owing to their cost, however, they only purchased at long intervals, each garment being of so durable a character that they are handed down to the third and even the fourth gen-

the latter. Rats make terrible work with ajvplefl if they can get to them. A very good arrangement is a hanging shelf or bin, which is made as follows: Nail strips of boards six inches wide and long enough to come within two and a half feel of the cellar wall. Two or three pairs of these hanging shelves are placed across or lengthwise of the cellar, upon them boards are laid, w ith sides and ends six or eight inches high. Upon these shelves apples are emptied directly from the basket.
SCOTCH MIST
Tourist# in Scotland are sometimes surprised to hear the name "mist” applied to what seems to them rather a shower of rain. The peculiarity of Scotch mist is that the drops of
mosquitoes during the months. It is at the beginning of the hot weather that the mosquito draws the parasite from the blood of some patient who is infected with it, and who tk&s a relapse, and then for the next three months the mosquito shelters it, allows it to breed, and transfers it. Human beings with malaria in their blood1 are therefore the "refuge home" for i be parasite during the months when the temperature does not allow, of its development in the mosquito. If, by* the use of quin-during these nine months relapses In the human being could be prevented, the mosquito would have nowhere whence to draw bis parasites when the heat began.
