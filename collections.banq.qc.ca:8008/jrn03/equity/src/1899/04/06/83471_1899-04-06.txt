While the hare run the IOO yards the tortoise would gain a fresh start of ten yards. While the hare cleared this off, his slower competitor would make a yard. When pussy had paced the yard the start would be one-tenth yard ; similarly it would be reduced to one-hundredth, one-thousandth, and so on. but it never vanishes. I wonder how many of my rea«lera can show where the fallacy lies?

Itev. Mr. MoGillivray, in seconding this resolution
very fully with the pleasure of the mover of this resolution in rising to second it. My pleasure does not reach quite as far as that of the mover. He is hot h a policyholder and a stockholder. I only have the privilege of being a policyholder in the Confederation Life Association, but I fee1 in that particular 1 have, in common with all policy holders, a very good and a very safe invent ment, and if it does not yield any very immediate returns it is sure to yield very satisfactory returns in due time, if not to myself, to others."
"No one can read the statement or hear it read without l>eing fully satisfied with the very satisfactory way in which the business of the association has l>een conducted and prosecuted during the year.
"It Is interesting to notice that the income from premiums is very near the million mark and that the income from interest and rents has I*en more than sufficient to pay all the death claims during the year.
"Speaking for the policyholders and as one who has now l>een a policyholder for twenty years I have very great pleasure in expressing my entire satisfaction with the way in which the business of the company is conducted, and the splended exhibit which has l>een presented to ua of the past year assures one that the greatest possible care has been bestowed upon our affairs by the directors and officers of the association, and with very great satisfaction l second the resolution proposed by Mr. Macdonald."

Including bonus additions, the new business for the year was #3,186,450. The total business in force at the close of the year was #29,077,418, under 19,950 policies on 17,106 lives.
The claims arising from deal h among the insured were very favorable, and considerably under those fur the previous year. There were 99 deaths, calling for the sum of #183,931 under 112 policies.
The valuation of the policy and annuity obligations of the Association has been made on the conservative basis used for the two previous yeara, namely ; a rate of interest of 3 1-2 per cent, for all business written since 1895, and 4 1-2 percent, for business written prior to that date.
The usual financial statements are herewith submitted, ami they will lie found to exhibit the position of the Contint ny at the close of the year.
The auditors have continued to make their audit each month, and their report will be found appended to the financial statements.
By reference to the financial statements, it will be noticed that substantial payments have been made to the Policyholders in the way of profits, the sum of $85,390.22 having been paid during the year. Taking the last four years, a total sum of #345,278 has been paid to Policyholders in this way, giving an average of $86,319. During the same four years the net interest and rents received have been sufficient to pay the net claims arising from deaths, and leave a surplus of $153,844); and during the same period, the expense ratio has been gradually brought down B result, in view of the volume of new business maintained and the existing conditions, your Directors believe will bear most favorable comparison.
Vour Directors, after careful consideration, concluded that the improvement in business generally would warrant them building on the vacant land on Queen street which forms part of the Head Office block, and they have accordingly erected a three-storey brick building containing eight stores and two flats, the latter used as showrooms. All were occupied as soon as finished. The balance of the vacant land south of the stores has been ground-rented, and the lessee has erected a brick building thereon, for warehouse purposes, so that what was non-productive, is now yielding a very fair return, in addition to paying taxes and all other charges.
Your Directors also, though receiving a good rental for the Yonge street shops in the Hvad Office building deemed It wrise, when the corner store became vacant some time ago, to make changes in the construction of the fronts on Yonge street and part of Richmond street, by which the heavy piers, which were undesirable from a commercial standpoint, will give place to a construction that will admit of more window space, and by that means be more suitable for the purposes for which the space is likely to be used. These changes are now being made, and will shortly be finished, and the whole space has been let at satisfactory rentals, and will be occupied as soon as the changes are completed. It will also be satisfactory to learn that the Head Office building is filling up with good tenants at fair rentals and with good prospecta.
Reference was made in the last annual report to the returns from the properties taken over in the City of Toronto, and your Directors are now able to report a still further improvement. in the returns, with better prospects for the present year both as to rents and sales.
The Directors are pleased to report continued diligent and faithful services

LIME AND FERTILITY.
The actual amount of lime taken by Drops is very small, but that little is essential. Wheat, for instance, takes Its phosphate as phosphate of lime and phosphate of magnesia, but the amount of the latter found in the gram ash Is four or five times as much as of the former. , Frank Wallis, of Lincoln, England, who la a high authority, says;—"Reference to Vine's table will allow us who* a small quantity the crop reaJly requires. The large quantities of lime used in the past have had a far greater faiflnenoe in that unfortunate precess of fertility denudation than in directly feeding the Drop. If, however, the Thomas-Phosphate form of phosphate is used, it will amply provide lime for all crop requirements, and for soils deficient In lime, Thoma»-Phosp(hate Is universally recommended as economically meeting a dual requirement.*'

Toronto, March 4th, 1899.
Sir W. P. Howland, President, in moving the adoption of the report and financial statement, said;—
"It affords us sincere pleasure, gentlemen to be able to present you with the report and statements in regard to the business and the position of the Company which you have just read. They afford evidences of satisfactory progress and success in every department of the Company's business. The new business secured during the year, notwithstanding the increased competition, was somewhat in excess of that obtained in (be previous year, and at t he end of the year we had insurances in force aggregating $29,677,418, an increase of $1,345,413 over the amount in force at the end of 1897. This large and satisfactory amount of business has all been obtained while the expense ratio of the company has been lees than (h it of the previous year, which proves that the business of
the association continues to be of a permanent ami reliable character. The death claims for the year» aggregated $183,! 31 w hich were $59,893 less than those of the previous year, Our financial statements show an increase in income for i he year of #46,670. There was paid to pul cyh dders during the year the large sum of $455 973. and our cash surplus over all liabilities according to the government standard ef valuation is $416,24X1, an increase over the previous year of $50,367,4)4)0.
"We consider that these facts fully justify us in the belief that they w ill prove eminently satisfactory to our |K)licyh ilders and shareholders, and will insure the continuance of the generous support which the company has received from the public."
Mr. W. II. Beatty, Vice-President, in seconding the adoption of the report, said :—
"I will just make one remark, which I ajn sure you will be delighted to hea*r, and 1 think it will be particularly gratifying, to the gentlemen of the field staff, namely, that this year down to the present time the business secured is largely in excess of that for th“ rorresponding period of last year, ami is y eater t w n that of any previous yea f *'
M W. Macdonald, in moving the resolution thanking the President and directors of the association for their faithful attention to the affairs of the company during the past year, said:— "Î do not think, in view of the report which we have just heard read am1 the remark * of the President and the one remark made by the V ce-Pres-•d-st, <hat * rw »r*ion of this kind ough to be * lered of a formal *.%*, "1er.

Apia, Samon Islande, March 23, via Aauckland, N.

Several villages have been burned, and there have been a number of casualties among the American and British sailors and marines. As yet it is impossible to estimate the number « f

As Mataafa and his chiefs, constituting the provincial government, continued to defy the treaty after the arrival of the Philadelphia, Admiral Kautz summoned the various consuls and the senior naval officers to a • onferonie on board the Pi i adelphia, when the whole situation was carefully canvassed.

The outlook for Canadian Lumber interest* in the United States and Great Britain were never so promising as at present, according to the opinion of Mr. A. F. Austin, wholesale lumber mer chant of Montreal, aa expressed to a Citizen representative. Mr. Austin states that on account of the recent uncertainty m the lumber tariff the American market was sold out, but now that confidence is restored, the Canadian supply is being drawn upon heavily. The expansionist idea in the United States has also had a marked effect on the lumber market, especially in the lower grades. A consider ab'e quantity is being shipped, more is going into the shipbuilding business, and manufacturers are also calling for greater supplies of b-'X lumber, etc Austin’s opinion that the Canadian lumber interests should be stringently safe guarded by the imposition of a tariff on the logs being exported. He states that if the present course is pursued for many years Uncle Sam will have depleted the Canadian forests, at little expense to himself. At present American labcgRg]g Canadian timber in Canada, manufacture it in the States, and sell it again in Canada w tbcut interference.

THEY FLED TO TIIE STATES.
In the North-West Territories the decrease is more than accounted for by the disappearance of a number of refugees who went to Montana after the disturbance of 1885, and at the request of the United States Government were brought back in 1895-96. It is expected that at any rate a proportion of these will rejoin their friends who have settled down and been doing well on their reserves. In the meantime their departure has converted what otherwise would have been an increase In the North-West

The area of land under cultivation during the year aggregated 111,880 acres.

AN OPEN FIRE.
Besides the factor of genuine happiness in the honte a fireplace repays ua for the care it requires in the most practical way. An open fire is the best ventilator that can Is* conceived, and if the living-room of a home have such a fire there is one spot at least where one is sure of pure air. Headaches will not be common in such a room, nor "nervous fidgets" from close, dry heat—such heat as marks the at moot furnace or steam healed In addition to the living-room fireplace there should be one bedroom at least in every house where an open fire may be commanded in case of sickness. The problem often most unsolv-able for both trained and untrained nurses is that of ventilation in a sickroom. With an open fireplace there is no question to solve, no thought necessary. Impurities in the air are sucked up as fast as they accumulate, and fresh air drops down, to be heated before breathed by the patient.
