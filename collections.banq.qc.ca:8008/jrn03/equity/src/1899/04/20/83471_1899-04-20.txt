The hum of the
Toronto, April 11
: will be heard at many a mill in the Geoigian Biy district this year to a far greater extent than for many past.
The logs cut last winter for the big Michigan operators on the bay must be i into lumber on this side under the Ontario regulations, and the result will be a remarkable increase of activity. The Michigan men refrained from making contracts until the last moment in the hope that the Ontario government would relax the regulations. A strong effort was made to secure a three months respite, which would have enabled the Michigan men to raft their logs over, but the government announced that the
gulation must stand.
The result has been that during the past two weeks the Americans have been making enquiries as to the facilities for sawing in Ontario preparatory to closing contracts.
Turner & Fisher, of Bay City, have closed a contract with a Midland farmer for the sawing of 200,000,000 feet to be afterwards taken over to Bay City. This alone means an expenditure of from 840,000 to $50,000, and other firms will be obliged to fellow suit.

BRITISH AND AMERICAN SAILORS SLAUGHTERED.
/
Auckland, N. %., April 12.—Bulletin. —Despatches received here from Apia, Hamoe, April 12, say that a party of 150 American and British sailors were forced to retreat to the beach, after having been caught in an ambush on a German plantation that day. The expedition was led by Lieut. A. H. Freeman of the British third class cruiser Tauranga. Lieut. F. A. 11. Freeman and Lieut. P. V. Lans-dale and Ensign J. R. Monaghan of the United States cruiser Philadelphia were
left dead on the field.
Ensign Monaghan remained to assist Lieut. Lansdale and was shot in retiring. Two British and two American sailors were also killed. The natives engaged were some of Mataafa s warriors. They severed the heads of the British and American officers killed. Priests of the French mission afterwards brought the heads into Apia. The manager of the German plantation has been arrested and detained on board of Tauranga, on affidavits declaring he was seen during the
w. tight among the rebels.
In a previous engagement twenty f Mataafa’s warriors were killed and here were no casualties among the Euro-

friend of mine, a lawyer, advised me to take a book agency saying he had edu» cated himself by canvassing; like drowning men grasp at straws. I took his advice, and in five years saved $6,000, and with this sum I started my present business. It is just fifty years ago today that Mr. Bradley, the founder of the present Firm of the Bradley-Garretson Company,
Limited of Toronto, sent me my first book prospectus, and to his beautiful letters and good advice, I owe much of my present success.

The many friends of the Rev d and Mrs Black, of Campbell’s Bay, will be sorry to learn that they have decided to leave this section of the country, owing to the desire of Mr. Black w parents to have him
with them.
The esteem in which this worthy couple is held was shewn by the fact that notwithstanding the bad state of the roads and rainy weat lier which prevailed Saturday, the 18th inst., several of their Bryson friends drove down to their home at Campbell’s Bay, for the purpose of presenting them with a souvenir of their
stay in this vicinity.
The presentation was accompanied by a neatly worded address which was read by the Rev’d Mr. Warrington, Anglican Incumbent of Portage du Fort, and feelingly responded to by Rev. Mr. Black. After partaking of refreshments provided by ladies of the party, and spending a few hours in social converse, the meeting was brought to a close by singing “ G<»d be with you till we meet again.”

I conceived the idea of digging out underneath a port mum of the cow stable, a*d dropp ng the manure down through.
This soil, saturated with the liquid excrement was worth far more for load, than ih.it taken from the piles. 1 then began drawing the hay from the cows In the stable. Gld boards, straw, etc., were used to stop the cracks and keep out the snow. Thus improvement was begun course grain feeding as practiced today was out of the question principal grain used was coin meal, which cost $50 per 'ton at the railroad 15 miles distant. The saving of fodder by feeding cows In the barn, the bettor quality of manure and warmer •tables, all combined, soon began to show in the haymows, and my stock of cows began to increase.

The King and Queen of Italy lead a very simple life. King Humbert is an early riser, and takes some exercise before breakfast. He eats very light food—a small roast, a little wine and ice water being the customary menu. After the noon meal the royal pair take a short nap, and at four o'clock in the afternoon they take a long drive.
King Humbert devotes his attention to the minutest detail of his household, economy and order being his watchwords. Eight o'clock in the evening is dinner time at the palace. Afterward the King visits the theatre or listens to private recitations, and he retire# promptly at midnight.
The Queen is devoted to Alpine climbing
sociatiun ha# paid tribute to her courage in this direction by electing her an honorary member.
In Gressuney, on the Piedmont Alps, lives Baron Peozoe, whose family has for years furnished guides for the royal Alpine tourists. The Queen often lives in the villa of the Baron, who is now her guide and whose father died in 1895 while touring the Alps with Queen Marguerite. The Queen wears the regulation Tyrolean costume on her tours.
She is very fond of the soldier's life. On many occasions she invites officers of the army to her court, and orders the distribution of wine and cake among the privates.
King Humbert loves the Piedmont Alps, but his sport is in hunting the deer. From a recent expedition his party returned with forty-five deer.

Is troubling a lot of men at this season of the year. If they would call and look over our largo stock and get our prices, they would have no trouble in in selecting a Spring Suit-made to order, made to tit. Come with the people.
THE BEST IS CHEAPEST.
It Is better to SERVE the public than to CHEAT It.
It Is better to make a FRIEND of a customer than a VICTIM.
It is better to HELP one’s patrons than to HURT them.
What is fair and just to the CONSUMER is best in the long run for the STOREKEEPER.
