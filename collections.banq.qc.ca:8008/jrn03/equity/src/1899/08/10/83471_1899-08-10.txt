Toronto, Aug. 5.—J. G. Scott, one of the Government’s forest rangers, has w:itten from Fort Francis asking to be released from tho position. A short time ago Scott started off on quite a long trip. He took with him John Crowe, another ranger and guide, who was n brother in. law. The weather was very warm, and when they had been out a couple of days Crowe showed sign* of delirium and went out of his mind. Several times Mr. Scott	had	to	chase him and
bring him back to camp. Finally, j Crowe made a dash through the woods ! and that was the last seen of him alive. With two Indians, who had been attracted by his shots and beacon tire, Scott j discovered the body of his companion in | a creek. This so unnerved him and so worried his family that he has sent his resignation to the Government.
