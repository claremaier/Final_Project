LONDON S WATER SUPPLY.
To London, as to almost every large city, the question of a water supply has been a serious problem. Londoners now see a way to solve it Engineer of the County Council has informed that body that underneath London is an immense lake, in a

to this lake, 1(K> feet below the surface of the ground, amounts to 280,-,WO.000,000 gallons, which would give daily yield of 707,000,0:W gallons. An artesian well has already tapped the lake at Clapham, and it is pointed out that all that is necessary to insure a water supply is to sink a sufficient number oi wells London should have existed for more than 2,000 years and never discovered that the great lake was beneath it.

The grass Is sappy and innutrioua
In Alay, and by July or August it either grows hard or woody or dries up so that cows will not eat so much of it, and what they do eat will not make eu much milk. So great is the need of extra feed for cows at Una time that ooru drilled for fodder is often cut before it has even got into blossom, and when it of course has very little nutri-So soon as corn matures sufficiently, that will furnish a ration that will materially increase the milk flow In cows at pasture, indeed many of the beet farmers put their cows in darkened stables during Augsut heals, cwrily to protect them from flies, i'bey find that entire reliance on soiling with green corn or with clover makes s larger milk flow, and makes it more Cheaply than dues reliance on pasture, even when corn is cut and fed daily as an adjunct to it.
This, we think, pretty nearly proves that, considering results, the winter feed of cows costs less than it does while they are at pasture. Most farmers deceive themselves into thinking that their summer pasture costs nothing, because they expend neither money nor labor to secure its product. The oow La turned, in, eating with one mouth, but all the time trampling the tender grass with four feet, soiling the grass, besides more or less bruising it and injuring its roots, if the pasture I» clover, this injury is so serious that stock ought never to be turned into a clover fiend until it ia nearly ready to

about the poorest feed that can be offered to a cow. Rut turn a cow into a field of clover when it is in blossoms, and what will be the result# She will trample through it, biting off the clover heads and soiling or destroying fully twice as much as she eats, if the *aane clover went out and fed green to the cow, she cannot separate the heads from the stem so well and will •ai the whole of it. In this way three times as much feed will be got from uu acre of clover as can be secured by pasturing. Sonne of the clover will be soiled so that the cow will not touch it through the remainder of the season.
Every farmer who has pastured clover known that toward fall, while must of the ground will be eaten down almost to the roots, there will Ue a considerable portion that has grown hard said woody, so that it has little nutri-
When the clover is eaten off early, the second growth promptly springs up and is both palatable and nutritious. That is what grows up after the first crop has been cut for soiling or for hay. A second, third and even fourth crop of clover may be grown if the soil is rich enough, and each one will be more nutritious than the first. This repeated cutting of clover is far better for the root growth than pasturing it can be, for in pasturing the constant trampling of the ground hurts the plant aud less-both Rs root and top growth. In tfhurt, clover will usually produce not only three times as much feed when cut with a scythe or mower as when pastured, hut it is nearly or qiute three times as much benefit to the land

The pigmies’ height brings them to the shoulder of a man of average stature, although some of them stand no higher than his chest. There are black pigmies and red pigmies. The bodies of the red pigmies are not so hairy as those of negroes, but the blacks’ bodies are covered with down. Although a well-propotioued race, they are socially inferior to other tribes. They are nomads by nature, and wander from place to place, supporting themselves by hunting. One place seems to be as much a home to them as another, if it is good hunting-ground.
Their revengeful nature and their hardihood in war cause them to be feared. They will lie aud deceive, but they will not steal.
The pigmy is an excellent archer. He will shoot three or lour arrows, one after the other, with such rapidity that the last will have left the bow before the first has reached its gaol. When an arrow misses its mark, the pigmy flies into

Why then, did the eighteenth century writers so misrepresent their women in their heroines ? Of course, the explanation of Mrs. Mey-nell's is the near though severe one.
They were not conscious of their sinning. They had not come to a comprehension of their subject. They pointed woman an their masculine conception told them that she wue, or ought to be—a mixture of patient Griselda and one-ideaed Jeannie Deans. Loving was her chief grace—not a poor one, loftily exercised, but lighting on creatures of the Thornhill or Lovelace pattern, the most debasing in human his- ^
tory. When the incorruptible Uamela PAINT HERALDIC DEVICES, confesses that she does " not blush," to give her coyly numbered kisses to the brutal lord, who had tried, and tempted, and insulted her by every beastly device known to his low nature, before making her his bride, she writes herself a hundred fathoms below the high-souled Romolas, who, torn in swift, though heart-breaking recoil, from the most fascinating Tito, who has shown the sign of the beust in hie forehead. And thereby, too, hangs the sequel of solution of the whole matter. A man's pen gave us Pamela, and woman's Romola, and not till woman rose to the telling of her own story did the half-centered Romolas, Marian Earles, and rapt Catherines of literature begin to interpret the other half of humanity to the world.
"The heroines of the past," says a recent writer, " were of only two kinds, the wholly good woman and the wholly bad," and the good or bad of it appears to hive been comprehended mainly in the idea of the huabmd, who was wont to say that his wife was an excellent woman ; she would do anything for him. " To love with unselfish and unfaltering devotion that was the good type," says this writer, " and It endures even in the works of Dickens and Thackeray." To be faithless and unloving, that was the bad one. and in either case It wvie wooden Only here and there a genius like Shakspetre, glancing from earth to heaven and perceiving the inherent elements in |

Une uf them—the Prince of W led—has been considered the probably choice, but tbe betrothal has been deferred so long that the court gossips have now concluded that it will never take place.

The picture is an inatanteous one, and it happens that the camera caught one of our soldiers as well. Dr. Bradford points out the gait of the Spaniards as illustrating the walk of utterly exhausted men, and contrasts it with the leisure gait of strength, as exemplified by the American soldier.

There is one sin which, It seems to us. is everywhere and by everybody underestimated, and quite too much overlooked in valuation of character. It is the sin of fretting, mon as air, as speech—so co unless it rises above its usual monotone, we do not even observe it. Watch any ordinary coming together of peo-

She rarely mentioned Dr. Melrose’s name; but I could well understand why she was silent.
So the winter passed. Two or three times the doctor came to relieve the monotony. My parents grew to welcome him ns a friend, and I, in my heart of hearts, as a brother, for I felt sure I had guessed the secret of his love for Maude.
He talked of her so constantly, tell-and how her beauty of character had far exceeded even the charm of face and form.
We looked to him almost am our deliverer, for fathers health and vigor were at last restored ; but when he asked him for him bill, he laughingly
replied :
" That was n private matter with Miss Maude. She is to settle that.”
My father looked amazed; could »|»preciate the payment he would accept and imagined their surprise when he should demand it at their hands.

We are making big preparations for the Fall Trade. Our Summer's Trade has been gratifying to us. We have been going
through our stock and we have no muslins or prints to clear out,
goods are remarkably well sold out for the time of year. This is a pretty good proof of two things, namely :
—THAT WE HAVE BEEN KEEPING THE GOODS THE PEOPLE WANT. —THAT OUR PRICES ARE PLEASING THE PEOPLE.

There is no apprehension felt hero < f the revolts spreading to the Indians outside the campaign in the mountains, and in fact the whole affair has reduced itself to a mere predatory raid by the Vaquis who are arttud with Remington repeating rifles. There are probably 1,200 Indians in the revolt and the campaign against them will bo sharply pushed. The main body of the Yuquis appear contented. There is some apprehension lest the Americans engaged in ranching near the scene of the Indian raids may be attacked. The troops will be employed to protect them.
