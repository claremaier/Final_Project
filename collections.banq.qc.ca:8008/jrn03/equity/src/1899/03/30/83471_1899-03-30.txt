COST OF PERFUMERY.
To produce the yearly output of perfumery in the Department of Sea Alps, in France, the Revue Statistique say*, requires 4,00(1,000 pounds, of roses, 6,-000,CO" pounds orange blossoms, 4H0.000 pounds jasmine, 34 0.0(0 pounds cassia blossoms. 300,000 pounds tube roses and 400,000 pounds violets. The average
price paid for these blossoms per pound is:—Roses, six cents ; orange blossom, seven cents ; jasmine, twenty-five cents ; tube roses, fifty cents; and violets and cassia blossoms, forty cents. One plant of violets furnishes about six ounces of blossoms and an orange tree about twenty pounds.
A woman can gather forty pounds of roses in four hours, or six pounds of jasmine in the same time. She can pick twelve pound of tube roses in a third of a day, but it takes a full day's work to gather twenty pounds of violets or orange blossoms.
To obtain one pound of essence requires :	Of roses, 32,000 pounds; or
nearly 5,000,000 single blossoms ; 2,000 pounds of orange blossoms, or 1,200.000 single Mowers. Each year's output of this district amounts to 1,000,000pounds of pomades, or cosmetics and 1,000.000 gallons of odorous fluids.

Then came the old War-Horse of the Opposition, Sir Charles Tupper, who although bearing the weight of <8 winters made a speech of 4\ hours duration, in Xhu course of which he made it decidedly uncomfortable for the gentleman on the treasury benches. According to the aged leader the record of the Government was one of broken pledges, incapacity, bung ling and dishonesty throughout.

Famine in Russia



St Petersburg, March 23.—The newt-papers of the city publish pitiable accounts of the condition of the so-called famine district of Russia, especially Samaria, in the eastern part of Europ Russia. The efforts of the Red Ci Society have staved off the actual horrors of starvation; but the society’s funds are almost exhausted, and the dire distress, compelling the consumption of all kinds | (’OOkIMi, I$OX AMI PARLOIR of garbage, has produced an epidemic of terrible mortality, with typhus, scurvy and other pestilential diseases.
The peasants are compelled to sell everything, and are living in cold, damp and filthy cabins. Weakened by hunger, they tall ready victims to typhus and acute scurvy. Unless the Government gives prompt aid, the Volga provinces appear doomed to a repetition of the horrors of 1891 and 1892.

He says it is to bo regretted that we have not as good railroad accommodation as the people living in the lower end of the country, and trusts that when the canal starts, it wont come as far an Black River and then stop there like the Pontiac railway.
The many friends of Mr. Martin Berlin, will regret to learn that he has been ill forsome time past, and as he is the oldest pioneer now living here, his recovery is doubtful.

Washington, D C., March 24.—The secretary of the Treasury has issued order for the free admission of binding twine into the United States from C.inada.
This is because of the fact that the new Canadian tar.tr puts binding twine on the free list when imported into that country, and the United States tariff only imposes a duty on the twine when iinportid from countries which make the article duii able.
