first hid been vastly disagreeable to the sensitive young man. Gradually, he mingled more with the "people, they had learned to like him, and were fast forgetting that he had ever joined the ranks of the foe and struck at his mother country. With the rabble who had met him at the depot on his first arrival at Rockland he was vastly popular, for forcing down his pride, he had been very conciliatory toward them, and they still adhered to their olden promise of making Inin their next police justice, provided he would lonsent to run.
With his usual impudence,
Baker continued to annoy the proud Bostonian with his good-humored familiarities, some of which Jimmie permitted, while others he quietly >ulsed, for Bill s constant allusions to he past were exceedingly disagreeable, ind as far as possible he avoided his luondam associate, who, without the least suspicion that his manner was iisgusting in the extreme, would hail him across the street, addressing h*Lu à I ways as "Corp’ral," and if strangers were in hearing, inviting him to ' call round and see a fellar once in l while for old acquaintance sake.'
At the Mather mansion matters remained about the same as when Jimmie first came home. Mrs. Carleton was still there, waiting for her other son, and Rose, as usual, was ever | the alert, seeking ways and means by which the soldiers might be benefited, compelling Jimmie to be interested in ber plans, dragging him from place to T>law, sending him on errands; and once, when in a great hurry to get l box in readiness for the hospitals at Washington, actually coaxing him into helping tie a comfortable, which was put up in her back parlor, and which must send immediately, for some poor fellow was sure to need it."

The following method of smoking beef and hams is in favor with many.
Smoke a barrel by inverting it eight or ten days over a kettle containing a smoldering fire. Keep water on the head of the barrel, and occasionally throw a pailful on the outside to prevent shrinking. In this barrel pack the meat and pour over brine to cover, |
