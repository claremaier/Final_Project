The British naval manoeuvres, now in process, are being shared in by 118 vessels, and twenty-five thousand men. People have become accustomed to great displays of naval force in British waters. Some have been the occasion of a larger number of vessels being gathered together. To naval men the movements of such a fleet, will, however have a greater meaning than the more spectacular reviews. A hundred and eighteen warships, all modern craft, all manned and equipped for service, engaged in work that resembles war in everything but the actual killing, will be a fact technical observers will appreciate at its value. Responsible statesmen have said that the ! fleet has within a year saved the Empire j from war. Its power as a peace preserver will be maintained by the preparedness that the possibility of conducting such huge manoevures implies.

Mr. Tarte’s paper, La Patrie, says the Province of Quebec is to share largely in the good things which the Laurier Government has to dispense this year in the line of railway subsidies. This expendi turo will be made according to that paper, to compensate for the millions that has been spent on the Crow s Nest Pass tor the exclusive benefit of British Columbia, and large sums will go to the Rainy River to benefit Ontario and Manitoba. La Patrie intimates that besides $1,000,000 for the Quebec Bridge, an additional sub sidy will be given to the Great Northern. The paper admits that this road has al ready received $3,200 per mile, but as the sections now under way are quite dif ficult of construction, further aid will be granted. This, however, is not all. The company will ask the Government to authorize the Quebec Harbor Commission to guarantee the interest on $200,000 at 4 per cent, for fifty years, to enable the company to build a million bushel elevator at that port. Another subsidy is I foreshadowed to permit the Canada Atlantic to extend its line from St. Justine station to the city of Montreal. A sub» sidy is also in order for the proposed bridge over the Riviere des Prairies at Bout de File. If the Canadian Pacific will extend its road from Labelle to Lake Nominique, the Government will grant a subsidy ot $3,200 for that purpose. Subsidies will also be granted to a railway along the south shore to Levis and also to any company that will build a railway from Paspebiac to Gaspe.

A Word to the Wise
i

2 00
Mr. George Taylor, Conservative whip in the House of Commons, made an exposure last week in connection with the Canadian binder twine industry which should be of considerable interest to the farmers, and at the same time convince them that they need not expect much consideration at the hands of our present rulers at Ottawa. When the late Government established a binder twine factory at the Kingston penitentiary the project came in for much adverse criticism on the ground that it would bring the product of convict labor into competition with that of the honest artisans of the country. This objection was met with the argument that whilst the latter would not be interfered with to any extent, twine manufactories operated by the Gov- j eminent not being under the thumb of combinations or rings, would lie in a position to regulate the price, and protect the consumer from extortionate charges.
But when the Liberals assumed office regard for this object was utterly ignored, and instead, they deliberately disposed of the product of the penitentiary to the binder twine combine, through a farcical method of tendering which netted the Government about 4£ cents per pound. The poor farmer, however, who should have had, and was entitled to any advantage in price that the Government would procure for him, had to pay about three times the above figure for what | twine he required. This affords ample of the methods by which the far- I mer is expected to prosper and grow rich May under Liberal rule.

Especially when they can be purchased at our prices.

To the coolness and bravery of Master Gordon Heron, aged 15 years, is due the rescue of live lives from drowning at Chelsea on Friday last. The parly thus rescued was composed of Ottawa ladies, who had gone in to bathe, in a locality which was supposed to be safe, but it seems some of the number got beyond their depth, and this led the others to at-temp their rescue, with the result that they all got into deep water. On assistance being called fur young Heron and a Mrs. Robert Lane, of Brandon, who couple of women soon reached the spot, was supposed to have been ruthlessly FJemn secured a rope from the camp,

It is reported, and with only loo much truth, that almost the whole of ihe Tsar’s dole found its w ay into the packet* of various officials entrusted with Its distribution, and that the hungry moujiks for whom it was intended have benefited scarcely by so much as one meal.
Seeing that the famine could no longer be kept concealed, the authorities recently consented to allow the press to speak of it. Appeals for aid have been made in all directions, and money is now beginning to flow in for succoring the afflicted provinces. But though the wealthy classes will gladly give their millions to build churches • nd found monasteries, or to help the H oppressed " Christians of the Balkans, they are very slow to send help to their own countrymen now dying in thousands and tens of thousands from starvation.

His prospects had brightened. He had won friends in the adjoining town, where he had labored faithfully among the sick and dying, and had been invited to settle among them. So he took Emma from her lonely home at the Willows, and they commenced their married life in the prettiest of little cottages.

Emma growing up pretty and a lady. The beauty was irrepressible, the refinement innate
homespun, the slender feet disguised in coarse, ill-fitting shoes, the sweet voice and fair face would yet attract a beholder ; and, in cautious crumbs and snatches, old Pardon gave her his heart.
Em mi soon learned that he loved her, and she loved him warmly in return ; but, both dreading domestic storms, they never demonstrated affection in Miss Millie’s presence.
But while Emma’s life was sweetened by the feeling that she had one friend, the woman’s was embittered by the fear that her favorite nephews—all Deans—would lose a penny of the Dean fortune.
When Emma was sixteen she would have been driven from the house to

The Red Cross Society is I Ions of oil making strenuous efforts to coins with the distress; unfortunately the. pro- j shells, portions of the present national calamity are so great as to put it entirely beyond the resources of that institution. In the Government of Kazan t he famine seems to be particularly severe. A correspondent writing from a village in that Government says :
" We opened soup kitchens on credit in the hope that money would be sent; no money has come in and we have been obliged to close the soup kitchens before the very eyes of the fam- ed homes or asylums for aged and inching multitude. The terrible plight firm beasts and birds
