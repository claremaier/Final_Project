It still wanted some minutes of the time at which Dolly ought to start in order to catch a train at the railway station, some two miles off, and she remained standing at the window, looking out over the sun-lighted sea end watching the tall mast of a ship la full sail sink below the horizon. She was roused by the recollection that it was tima to be off, and looking up at the old-fashioned clock which stood in coiner of the kitchen, she saw that it wanted five minutes to the hour When she should start.

The principal danger of food poisoning armes from the accidental contamination of food with foreign substances, and this is esjwially true of articles which are uncooked or unwashed, or which are cooled by putting ice into them All food stuffs which require cooling, including water, should be put into clean containers and ice should be packed around the containers, not introduced into the food or liquid. The interior of blocks of ice has been found to contain harmful bacteria, some of which resist a freezing temperature.

If he refused, they pushed him into

It should be borne in mind, however, that these diminutive cheese bring a better prie* in market than the large ones, solely on account of their size. 1 earnestly advise those dairymen who contemplate home cheese making at all to manufacture only small sized stuck if they would sell it readily for a good price.
Do not go into the business, however, unless you have some previous knowledge of it, as it will not prove profitable to experiment with so variable a product as milk.

It soon turned out, however, that the iK>Lson had nut been entirely got rid of and it spread through my whole system. The doctor was again called in, but looking upon my case as critical, advised me to go to the hospital at Belleville. This I did and remained there throughout the month of October, 1897. My condition was desperate, and as I was not making any progress toward recovery, 1 may frankly say that 1 gave my case up as hopeless. Believing that I could not recover, 1 asked to be taken home. I then tried various treatments with no better results. I could not walk without help, and I was doubled up like a jack-knife. At this stage l was advised to My Dr. Williams' Pink Pills and sent for half a dozen boxes. After using the first half dozen my appetite returned and night sweats which had been the bane of my sleeping hours deserted me. Knowing that the pills were helping me I sent for a further eujiply.

From the above estimates it is evident that the water power scheme is the most preferable, owing to its less yearly cost for operating, and if adopted by your town, it will, during the first year, he nearly self supporting, and feel confident* in future years, that you will have additional consumers, which will reduce the hydrant prising.

The two big#sawmills owned by Messrs. Robert and J. Conroy, Dojchenea, were totally destroyed Vy lire on Wednesday evening of last week. The Desahenus company’s power house and the grist mill were only saved after the hardest sort of woik by the residents of Deschenea.
Nearly 200 men have been thrown out of employment by the disaster.
About seven o'clock an inky black cloud was noticed moving from the west. It slowly settled over Lake Deachenes, and the sky was soon vivid with forked lightning. After an unum diy sharp flash the south corner of the mill, facing the south was seen to be on tire. The mill had been struck bv lightning. The fire spread with frightful rapidity, and ere the villagers had gathered the entire mill was in flame». In less time than it takes to tell the tire spread to the adjoining mill, and the mill hands, to the number of one hundred and fifty, saw that it was utterly usekss to attempt to save the property. The rain came down in torrents, but this had little effect upon the fire.
The cry went up 44 Save the power house and grist mill.” Two hydraulic pumps, one at the power house and the other at the grist mill, were brought into posit vault.

New Yoik, July 7.—The WorW to-day i prints an alleged interview with M. La- bori, counsel for Dreyfus, in Parts. , v M. Labori said Dreyfus had tola him & tale of devilish torture to which ho had been subjected on Devil’s Island.
llis guards wore the worst ruffians that could bo picked from the Guiana police, who imagined that they would gain favor by treating the prisoner with violence. Once when Dreyfus was suffering from fever ho accidentally upset a jug of water near his bed. As a punishment he was denied water for twenty four hours, and at noon the next day he was almost mad with thirst
ot the colonies sent a letter saying that Dreyfus would attempt to escape (the letter was proved a forgery.) Dreyfus was chained to his bed and left that way for twenty days. Another heartless measure the keeping of a lighted lamp over the prisoners bed at night. This was claimed necessary in order to keep Drey fus constantly in view.
The light was the means of attracting millions of tropical insects which almost ate him alive. Letters from Mme. Dreyfus were suppressed with the object of making the prisoner believe that he had been abandoned by his friends, and so to his son entering professional life, was extract a confession from him
that he had a brother, who, while very even intimated to him that his wife was * clever, had nothing to show f >r his years anxiou* to marry. Dreyfus said he had
