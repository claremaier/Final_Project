Would he have loved her so much if Nature hail extended her cruel stejnmother's touch on the girl’s cars to the lines of her face and figure/ l trow not. Men wijl do a great deal for what pleases them, but nothing at ail fur that which pleases them not. And deafness is an unbeautiful thing, and needs much love and pai iem e in those who have to bear with it.
Poor Elizabeth used to any that deaf people were sent into the world to practice patience themselves, and discipline others to patience also; but Jack would not have changed her fur the must perfect person, mentally and physically, in the world. But that was then, and this was not. And on the morrow his cell would be empty, and he standing in the dock.

of Ontario, died at his residence on Sim, coe street, Toronto, ten minutes to three I o'clock, on Wednesday morning last.
Id is illness, which had extended over some years, had confined him entirely to the house for some time past, and for the last few days it had been known that the end could not be long postponed. Throughout yesterday and last night his physicians were in constant attendance ar ins bed side, and everything that could be done was done to prolong the life of the man, who was among Canada's foremost sons.
Sir George, however, sank steadily, until at length the vital spark guished, and he passed quietly away.
Sir George Airey Kirkpatrick, Lieut.-Governor of Ontario, etc , was born in Kingston, Ont., 13ch September, 1841, and is the fourth son of the late 1 hos. Kirkpatrick. Esq , Q. C., who came from Cooluiine, County Dublin, Ireland.

Not faraway ia a curious spot, known as " Liziie’s l awn " Here stand on a rich sward four arbor vitaes of enormous size, which can be seen for miles around, towering high above the branches of the forest itself. These were named for the four slaters of Colonel Tigbe.
Turning down this leafy walk or that, one comes upon exquisite bowers, all appropriately named—the Lennox, the Richmond, etc.,—and all testifying to the fondness of Colonel Tighe for his lovely and high horn wife. There Is also the Silver Spring, a bubbling well of water, justifying its name. Icy cold, pel-lucent and singularly refreshing, and from which each morning two pailfuls are carried three miles for Her Lady ship's us**. To maintain Woodstock costs £8,000 every day.

Near Kilkenny, Ireland, on the hank' of Hiver Nore, lies Woodstock, the vast estate ef Lady Louisa Tighe, and here, surrounded by every luxury and loved and honored by all who know her, lives the daughter of the Duke of Richmond, who almost a century ago buckled on Lord Wellington's sword when he left Brussels on the campaign which amazed the world.
Dominated by its superb baronial mansion of granite, hewn and carved on the estate, Woodstock exends over a circuit of forty miles, and its walks, roads and drives, extend five hundred miles. Connected with the est ate are
