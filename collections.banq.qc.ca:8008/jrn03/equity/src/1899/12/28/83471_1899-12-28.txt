T1"» principal drawback and hindrance to agricult ural thought, profit And prog e<s, is a la k of union und sxmpathy between scientific) theory and the every day practice of the farm. As yet there is a wide gulf between the tcacher of agricultural ecicnoc. and the working farmer, and our farinera are especially lacking in apprécia lion of the great value to them uf the scientific teacher. They are sure that the facts which environ t htsia are the same aa those wh ch surround the tcac her. Isolation on the farm coinpeLs the farmer to be independent and aelf-reli ant. He paii dvi>end on no oue but him elf for tic soundness of bis judgment or a hand to execute it. He thinks that xory much of what is done at experiment mations, taught at agricultural col left**, or related in dairy unit (farm paiera, is nothing but t hcory.
Wien our farmers evidence a disposition to resptet what scient» is paticutly doing for them, and become more studious and intelligent, they will mike more money. Hut something must be done to close up this gap between the farmer and what agricultural science has to offer.

Mr. Monet, M.

If however, 25 electors can be found who will attach their names to a requisition to resign his seat, he ia prepared to do so. We shall be glad to learn that the opportunity is afforded him.
The report of the 25th annual meeting of the shareholders of the Bank of Ottawa, published in full in the Ottawa papers a few days ago, shows that this institution continues to prosper and increase in financial strength. The net profits for the year just closed amount to $217,000, while a considerable sum has been added to the rest account. Nine cent bonuses and dividends has been paid to shareholders, and new branches have been opened at several places.

In 1850 he was selected by the Tache-Macdonald administration to conduct a survey of the Ottawa and French river navigation, better known as the proposed Georgian Bay canal, the result being a report highly commendatory of the project.
His greatest achievement, however, either as engineer or contractor, was accomp lished in the United States, where, associated with his brother, the late Mr. Frank Shanly, also an engineer of note, he constructed the celebrated Hoosac mountain tunnel, in Massachusetts. As a politician, the late Mr. Shanly sat in the old Canad* assembly, for South Grenville, from 1863 till the accomplishment of confederation in 1860—a measure which had his hearty support. At the union, he was re turned for the same constituency to the house of commons, and continued therein, during the first, fifth andsixth parliaments.

An Omaha man is out with a letter in one of the newspapers of that state, calling upon the Clan-na-Gael and other Fenian organizations to prepare for an invasion of Canada. If this enterprising individual’s aim is to check the ardor of Canadians to volunteer for service in South Africa, he is certainly wasting hie energy. Those who are going to Africa have a pretty well-defined belief that they leave behind them a rather rugged lot of stalwarts to look after things at home during their absence. The good shots are not all going to Africa by any means.

Montreal, Dec. 15.— Somewhat of asen-eation vas caused at the Montreal Liberal club last night by a speech made by Mr. W. A. Weir, M P. P., the president of the club, who took advantage of the recent Liberal defeats to strongly criticize the conduct of the Liberal leaders, who he declared were too apothetic. The Conservatives were much better organized than the Liberals and were better fighters than the Liberals, and he warned them that the Conservatives would stand a good show of success at the next elections if the Liberals did not wake up and makes better fight.

The United States Government calculates on spending $631,000,000 next year. That is a huge sum, indeed, and is partly accounted for by the need of laying out $260,000,000 on the army and navy. Our neighbors can gather some comfort, however, by looking to Canada. Taking population into account, according to the Laurier Government’s record, they van spend $700,000,000, and not be worse off than the Cominion.—Montreal Gazette.

white, but his long straight hair is sjill more black than gray. He speaks English with a piquant lack of grammar and in.suae of words. When the Chronicle man traveled with him next day, almost the first thing the General said was, "The heart of my soul is bloody with sorrow."

In feeding steers for market, there are at least four important considéra-tioros to be observed at the start—the
selecting, the buying, the feeding and the wiling. Any one of these, poorly managed, is frequently enough to spoil the profit in feeding.

Nevertheless, it would he unsafe to assume that the visit had no political significance, in that there cannot fail to follow from It one important conse-qu< non, that is, an increased aasuran e if not of the friendship of Germany, at least of her neutrality in any deferences between Great Britain and other powers. For if the Kaiser were not disposed to be as friendly to Great Britain as German interests will permit, he would not conceal his indisposition by a friendly visit, if not because he is too honest for that, then because It would subject all his personal acts to suspicion of insincerity. But If he is disposed to be friendly, as his visit show* him to be, he will mot unite with other continental sovereigns in any combination against Great Britain, in which event the lati ter is practically relieved from any danger of attack from that quarter which she cannot certainly resist. For with Germi ay holding aloof, Frame and Russia would not challenge the British fleet, in the knowledge that, with their fleets destroyed Germany would have it in her power to cut/ the former off from her African dominion, and the latter from her possessions in the Far East,

Without a coalition in which Germany joined, the risks of war with Great Britain would b* too great, and the visit of the Kaiser shows that not only wiil Germany not join, but that she recognizes the fact that, friendly relations with Great Britain is the condition on which alone Germany's colonial schemes can be successfully carried out. With scattered colonies to protect, and an eager desire to found more, the interest of Germany $s to maintain at least a friendly neutrality toward Great Britain, and so lew g an she does that, the hostility toother powers will not greatly affect England. With their strong political sense, Englishmen perceive this olenr-ly, and though the Kaiser as the Queen's guest would have been well treated in any event, his reception was
not the less courteous because of that knowledge.

YULE TIDE DECORATIONS.
What to devise in the way of new aud original decorations for the holiday season, is truly a perplexing question, and one not easily to solve in this day and age. Florists and decorator* give a great deal of thought and attention to this subject.
At a delightful gathering last Christmas, the decorations were so unique and effective, that a description of them may prove helpful to those who are contemplating a holiday entertainment. In the centre of the huge table was a long flat mirror edged with holly and ferns. Over the surface was scattered a number of
gondolas, tiny boats and vases, in the form of swans filled with) scarlet carnations and maiden's hair ferns. Suspended from the chandeliers were two large balls of red chrysanthemums. Large red candy boxes tied with huge bows of ribbon were used as flowers. Mantels and odd niches were banked with holly, ferns and palms.
At another pretty dinner parly,scarlet ribbons and clusters of holly were festooned to the four corners of the table. The place cards consisted of calendars in the form of hearts done Ln water colors, with s Scarlet ribbons, palms, were lavishly used throughout the rooms.
Holly and evergreen will transform the plainest and moat commonplace dining room into a veritable bower of beauty. If there is an unsightly place the walls, make a huge screen of Bvergreon* wh*uh will entirely Wreaths dotted here and th the glossy holly can be used on the pictures and in tho windows.

A NEW KIND OF BRICK
In Germany the granulated slag from blast furnaces is being utilized for the manufacture of brick making of slag brick is not a new, thing but heretofore fluid slag has been employed for the purpose, and the brick thus produced has been found unsuitable for build.ng purposes because it ie Impermeable to air and steam. But the slag bricks made in Germany a » e, it is said, not open to this objection. On the contrary, wb le exceeding the strength of ord nary bricks and possessing an extraordinary resistance to heat, they are more permeable to air, and consequently -, well suited for the building of houses.
