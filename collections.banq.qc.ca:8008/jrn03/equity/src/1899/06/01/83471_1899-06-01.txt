HOW TO GROW TEA ROSES
LOOK AT A SERVANT'S HEAD.
The newest idea is to choose servants by the shape of their head. II the head extends well back behind the ll ears, the mistress may be satisfied that the " domestic region " is well developed and the servant will be capable. A good lady’s maid should have the lower portion of the brow broad and prominent, signifying artistic sense and the ability to make everything look its best. As it is a poor rule that does no; work both ways, perhaps it would be wise for the servant to choose her mistress by similar methods.

" Well, to get back to Medicine lid, there was a famous lllackfoot ch-ef who lived somewhere around io that pert of the country. He divided his time between hunting and making war, •n the Créés. This chief’s * good medicine ' was a most gorgeous le Address of feathers. He called it his medicine hat, and it was the luckiest 'good medicine ' in all the region aiound. Well, one day he fell upon the Creeu just about where our town n #w la and he smote them hip and thigh. He was in afuir way to wipe the Créés out of existence when along came a gust of wind and lifted the magic hat off his head. That was bad enough but worse was to follow. The wind whirled it up on high, carried it faster than he could chase it on his pony, and finally dropped it in the Saskatchewan river. That was too much for Mr. Black foot.
