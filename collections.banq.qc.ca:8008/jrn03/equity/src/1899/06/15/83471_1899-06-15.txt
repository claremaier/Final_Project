SHAWVILLE.
80 TheVotracted delay which has marked | ^Vemo^al the continuaism and completion of the Pontiac road, is a matter which is calling forth universal disapproval; and when looked at observantly, seems to present the feature of bad policy as well as inexcusableness. In the Best place no reason
ed if it were. As it is, however, with the »ome ruthan. terminus in the bush at Black River, the road is practically inaccessible to farmers in the upper end of the county. When they have stock such as cattle or sheep to ship, they prefer the risks of the ferry between Allumette and Pembroke to the bother and annoyance of driving the animals for miles along a narrow bush road, where often it is impossible to keep them under control—in order to reach the present terminus of our railway.
These with other commodities shipped out of that section, we are told, means a loss of several thousand dollars a year to the P. P. J. R. which would go to that road instead of the ferry, if it were continued a few miles farther up through the
CThe Rem of pretty heavy expense which confronts any effort to continue the road, it is well-known, is the obstacle which has intervened to prevent its progms westward. If the road is to be finished to its proposed western terminus at least two expensive bridges must be built. Still it seems reasonable to argue that the increased traffic the road would thereby secure would justify the necessary outlay. At any rate it affords the only prospect in sight of making it pay, which in its present incompeted condition, it cannot be doing. Moreover, a speedy completion of the work will afford the most probable check to the prosecution of the rival project. If the latter should by any combination of circumstances get fairly under way, and the proposed road should reach Pembroke in advance of the P. P. J., the latter must inevitably suffer, and the people who are paying out tbsir hard earned dollars year by year, without receiving any benefit, may realize some day that their last hopes of getting a railway have vanished. For those people the situation is certainly a serious one, and it is earnestly hoped it may be improved before the opportunity passes away.

The sale of the water power at the Chats falls, which was to take place at Quebec on Friday last, was again postponed, no date being fixed. The upset price was $20,000, but no offers were made for sale en bloc but only for certain portions of the chutes, and these offers are now under the consideration of the commissioner cf crown lands.
Mr.G. F. Hodgins spent a couple of days last week in Thorne west, inspecting some of the mica deposits which have been discovered in that section. We understand G. F. has secured options on several of those properties, and intends doing some developing shortly
this topic we may also state, that the mica showing on the property of Mr. G. Atkinson in the same locality and recently acquired by Rev. V. Ferreri, of Vinton, promises to pan out satisfactorily.
Theft of a Horse and Rio —On Wednesday, 31at of May. Mr. Bouchette, liveiyman, of Fort Coulonge, hired a horse and buggy to a young man named Kelly, who said he would be back in a couple of hours. Kelly, however, did not turn up at the appointed time, and when a day or two passed, Bouchette, naturally growing uneasy about his property started to search for the missing horse but could find no trace of them for several days when he finally located the harness and buggy in Onslow on the premises of Mr. P. Murdock, to whom Kelly had sold the articles for $15.00. Kelly in the meantime had exchanged horses somewhere, and left the exchanged animal also at Murdock’s saying he would return for it. Subsequently it was ascertained that Kelly had been at Mrs. Johnston's in Wakefield, where he left Bouchette’s horse, and procured a horse from the lady named to drive to Hull. The horse left at Murdock’s, supposed to be Mrs. Johnston’s, was taken to Wakefield by Bouchette and Murdock on Friday last. The young man Kelly, told Bouchette he came from Clarendon.
Masonic Parade.—The second annual church parade of Pontiac Lodge took place on Sunday afternoon last. About 75 craftsmen were in attendance, includ* ing members of Madawaska Lodge, Arn-prior, Eddy Lodged Hull; King Solomon, Aylmer, and a few representatives from Ottawa. The latter reached here at 2 o’clock by special train from Aylmer, and were accompanied by a number of young people from Aylmer and other points along the line. At Quyon the train was boarded by the resident members of Pontiac Lodge, with a contingent of the citizens of that place. Arriving here the visiting brethren congregated local Masons at the lodge room, and subsequently formed in order of parade and marched to St. Paul’s church, which meanwhile bad been gradually tilling up

Whitney I chose two sites with a view of ascertaining which was the better, had a southern exposure, the lines extending east and west, entirely protected on north side, while upon the ether the lines were planted to extend north and south, fronting the east and protected on the west and north. The seeds were put in about the first week of April. Those planted on the south side came up first, and the vines grew tall and beautiful, while the others were comparatively slow in showing themselves above ground.
For the south side vines I had provided wire netting and for those on the east side used ordinary twine fastened to stakes set about three feet apart. I soon found the netting, although by far the more convenient, by no means a good arrangement for the vines, for the wire, acting as a conductor of heat, withered and dried them so that by noon the stems hung limp and flabby, while the flowers had lost their brilliancy of color. 1 began io notice this almost as soon as blossoms appeared, and then watched to see if the same thing occurred with my east side vines. 1 found it did not,

The following year I planted only upon the eastern site, lines extending north and south, entirely protected on the west, using no wire for the runners, and the results were equally good.
