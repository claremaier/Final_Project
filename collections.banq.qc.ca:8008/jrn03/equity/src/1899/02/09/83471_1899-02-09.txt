Mr. H. A. Wartman, of Kingston, has been here for a few weeks pest, introducing hit Portable and Stationery Square Braced Fence Poet, for which he has letters patent. This fence is made of or dinary rails, stakes and wire, and has been largely adopted by farmers throughout Ontario. The cost of building is from 15 to 17 cents per rod, wire furnished. As we understand it Mr. Wartman sells either farm, township or county rights for the erection of this fence, which from the models we have inspected, is of a different style from any yet introduced in •his section. It seems to be very easy of oou-truction, and strong, while wind can not affect it to any degree.

Mr. John Douglas, principal of the Portage du Fort School, was in town on Saturday and favored The Equity with a He informed us Mr. Valleé, an enI gineer of the Quebec Government, was at Portage du Fort on Thursday for the purpose of making an inspection and reporting on the bridge, part of which collapsed some time ago. This action is taken to indicate that sonic move is in contemplation to restore the structure, the loss of which has been a very heavy blow to the interests of the village, as well as causing a serious inconvenience to the travelling public at large.
Sudden Death —A very sudden death —that of Mrs. John Anderson, of Maple Ridge, Bristol—occurred at St. Luke's hospital, Ottawa, at 4 30 on Friday morn ing last, from secondary hemorrhage, as the result of operations she had performed at that institution, to which the de ceased !ady went on Monday previous, with the object mentioned Two operations were performed, the first on Thursday morning, and the sec nd in the afternoon, and it appears the case was of a much more serious nature than the physicians apprehended, hence the sad result already recorded. Mr. Anderson, wh«* accompanied his wife to Ottawa, returned home with her remains on Friday nigh* and on Sunday they were interred at Nor way Bay Cemetery, a large concourse o sympathetic friends and acquaintances being in attendance.
fbe deceased Mrs. Anderson was the ihitd daughter of the late Richard Campbell of Bristol. She leaves to mourn her 1 »**, besides her bereft husband, little girls, all of whom have the unre served sympathy of the community.

What makes such extra rush this year is the purchase of the Fraser limit at Lake Traverse, by Messrs. McLachlin Bros., who intend putting in 500 tons of supplies this year.
The usual number of parties is going on this year—some over and some to come off yet. The last but not least was at George Jewel’s, when that annual sleighdriving party from Pembroke, Chapeau and surrounding country came up and was met there by a lot of people from other places, all keen for amusement,
Dancing commenced and was kept up pretty much all night. To let you know it was a success, let it suffice to say that with Miss Fleming at the organ, T. Barry with violin, and T. Jewel, Master of Cer-, failure was impossible; and any person acquainted with Mr. and Mrs.
Jewel knows that their guests are always made comfortable and happy. Some of the party said the road was pretty rough nearAumond Lake. Don't mind that— it was only a short piece lately travelled.

The much talked about Anglo-American friendliness is not all newspaper and after dinner " guff,** an some pea-eimiatio people are fond of saying?* It has a good substantial and popular basis ae many evidences go to show.
One of the most recent of these is given by the Chicago Record aa follows :
There is music in the air at Fort Sheridan the Record says. It Comes from the quarter on the ;»eeojnd floor to the left of the archway, lacing the parade ground and floats in brt*en strains with frequent halte to the ears of all who come that way. Tommy in his company room hours it, laughs and aays that it beats various kinds of things. He also asks his grinning bun-kie if “ that wouldn’t kill him/'
The officers striding along the cement walk on their way to the adjutant’s office, «mile as the soumU of burn, cornet and snare-drum reach their ears, and there is gratification as well as amusement in their smiles.
The fact that the hand is practising does not usually excite much remark at the fort, but the airs they are
playing now have set1 the men talking and wondering from one end of the barracks to the other. Opbfràtlc music is as a thing forgotten. Even the “ Star-Spangled Banner,” is never heard except at retreat. 6uch comparatively recent favorites as " A Rot Time iq the Old Town ” and " Dixie "
have passed from the minds of the earnestly striving musicians, who are now blowing their whole souls into " Rule Britannia " and " British Grenadiers,’*
In the words of the second clarinet :
; ANYTHING ENGLISH GOES."
The reason why the band is seeking to acquire the melodies of Albion to much an extent that it has qven added * La Tiddledy Iddiey Umpty Umpty Ay ” to its repertoire is that the soldiers of the United States army and ' the widow's men/’ ere likely to be | defer Doinmingly within a few weeks in friendly fashion ami on British territory.	’ .
The order has gone forth, it is said, that the brigade in which the 4th is | then, prayt part, will disembark on its way to the Philippines in the most jealously guarded strongholds of Great Britain, t^iere receiving such a welct/me as has never been accorded to an armed foreign force since the redcoats first planted their flags and mounted their guns.
The order conveying the route to the commanding officers of the brigade names, it is said, Gibraltar, Malta, Cairo Bombay and Singapore as the places where the troops are to lan<L At!Malta the stay of the American troops will extend, it is said, to a period of four days. ,
It is jagafried by many as significant of mor'e IhWn ordlnary feeling of friendship toward the United States on the part of Great Britain that that Power should allow the landing of armed forces on her territories, and that by accepting the concession the United States shows her willingness to return the hospitality extended at any time that it becomes necessary. At all events, this is the view the soldiers at Fort Sheridan take of it.
They are beginning to be eager for the start and the few books of Eastern travel in the meagre little library are being diligently thumbed. Half a dozen eager heads are crowded at a time over a picture of *he sterile rock off the Sicilian coast, where they guess that the British bandmasters are now Instructing their meu huw to play "Hail Columbia " and " Yankee Doodle,” and those who saw the streets of Cairo at the World’s Fair are tailing their ad- | you miring comrades what they may peot to see.

consequence diminished, and, in short, Russia could not reach the holders of India with more than two-thirds of her
original army.	... ,	,.
To oppose this army the British could
bring up a nearly equal number of Indian troops. and still leave 130,000 for Abe maintenance of British supremacy In India. In addition, their fleet, carrying 35,000 troops, could twice make the Journey to India and back before the Russians could reach the border. Besides all this, they could be drilling the warlike tribes of India, and thus increasing their forces.
Then, too, they would have several lines of defence even after the Indian border had been crossed, and the Russians would be fighting far from their base of supplies. Unquestionably, however, there are various eventualities that must be taken into consideration, ¦ f^r instance, France and Russia

And thus, 1 think, bon. members will hire plainly before their eyes one great oauee of the depression and tha iropo ished condition of the people, ns. tha a year —leaf year—the Government took more then six millions of dollars out of the people than was necessary on the basis of the expenditure in 1879, provid ing for the contingency of increased pop ulation that haa taken plaoe since. This amount ie 96 per cent, over what it ehould have been, after allowing the percentage for increased population.
Plainly, unless inese two great Liberal leaders were given over hopelessly to the vise of exaggeration, a esd state of affairs prevailed at that time. According to Sir Richard, this taxation of thirty millions enslaved every workingman in the country for thirty long dnye; and in the eyes of Mr. Paterson, it wan six millions higher than it should have been. We can only marvel that the country was not more visibly impressed end tremendously appalled by the fearful condition of things thus revealed.
