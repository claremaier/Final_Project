Of other kinds of brushes in cylindrical form there are many, the familiar bottle brush being one. Another is the little pipe-cleaning brush. Larger brushes of this sort are u ed for cleaning boiler flues^ and brushes of this kind are often made to order, for special uses, and of various sizes of brush and length of handle, according to the size and length of the pipe through which it is to be drawn; the brush, it might be, of the dimensions of a lamp chimney, or bigger, and the handle of stout wire, and evily, you should spend the remain- perhaps twisted, ten, fifteen, eighteen

Much, however, remains to be done before the wonderful system of waterways with which Providence has endowed Can* ada will be brought thoroughly and really effectively into the service of man. At present those that aro canalized are mainly those on the borders of both Canada and the United States, and although built and maintained by Canada, are practically of as much service to the United States as they are to the Dominion. By treaty, also, they are subject to Uni' ted States jurisdiction, and the rights of Canada and Great Britain over them are restricted.
