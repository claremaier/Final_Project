Of canal-tunnels proper, the longest is the Riqueval tunnel, on the St. Quentin canal in France. It is 21 feet
wide, 41 feet high and 21-2 miles long.
The Hoirran tunnel, which brings water to the same canal, is 71-2 miles piVi long, but it can hardly be called a can- Jjj;: a 1-tunnel in the ordinary sense, as it is hut live feet wide and cannot be used for ordinary canal boats. Anothr er French canal-tunnel on the Marne-

In England the longest canal-tunnel 1 ^ is the Standege tunnel on the Huddersfield capital; it is 3 1-10 miles in length.
Next to it comes the Sapperton tunnel, the Thames and Liverpool m‘1; it is 4,300 yards long.	' l

DANGER OF RICE-THROWING
An example of the dangerous natun of the practice of throwing rice at weddings, occurred at Charing,
Ashford, in Kent, England, immediately after the marriage of Canon Carter, of Canterbury Cathedral, and Miss Sayer, of Prett Place. Just as the couple were leaving the bride's houses fur their honeymoon, a shower of rici struck, the horses, some of it entering, their ears. This caused them to boll with the result that the carriage wai overturned. Both of its occupanteiwen severely shaken and bruised, and the K ^

would therefore be within the competence of the Manitoba Legislature. The only thing to be considered is the wisdom of it.
Of that, we think, there can be no doubt for two sufficient reasons—First, the one stated by Mr. Macdonald; second, the necessity for bringing these strangers into harmony with the rest of our population by their acquiring and understanding the language, laws and institutions of the country. The danger of admitting mass ea of ignorant foreigners to full citizenship before they have acquired such knowledge was demonstrated in the l ni-less effective than the fact they deal with. | ted States, and led to the enactment of
