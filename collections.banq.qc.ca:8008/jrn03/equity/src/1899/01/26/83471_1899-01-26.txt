( From the Of hi km Journal, Jan. 1S.)
The agitation in favor of the construction of the Ottawa Georgian Bay ship canal was given much additional impetus last night. That the project is being considered by all classes of the community was well shown by the large and distinguished audience in the city hall last night. The place was crowded and for several hours the advantages of the scheme v ere dilated upon by epe ikvre from diff -rent parts taw a valley. Mr. Peu pore, M. P, made the importent announcement that Sir Wil frid Laurier was convinced of the in cos-fity and feasibility of t he scheme and intends giving Mr. Poupore an opportunity to explain the project at a cabinet meeting to he held at an early date.
