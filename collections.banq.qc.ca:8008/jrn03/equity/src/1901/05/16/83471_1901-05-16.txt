PRO-mtR PAPERS JOIN.
Cape Town, May 11. — The South Af 8.50 rican News today declares it has been decided to reconstruct the ministry, with Cecil Rhodes as premier. Dr. Jameson as colonial secretary, and John Gordon Sprigg as treasurer.
The premier (Sir John Gordon Sprigg) however, authorises a statement that there ia no foundation for the reporta of the reconstruction of the cabinet.
London, May 10.—The war office here denies the statement published in New York that Lrrd Kitchener has telegraphed advising yielding all the demands of the Boerj with the exception of independence, owing to his conviction that they cannot be forced to lay down their arms without a long continuance of the war.
