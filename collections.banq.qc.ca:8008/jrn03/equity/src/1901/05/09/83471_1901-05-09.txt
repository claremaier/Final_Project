MR. B0R0KN 8 TALK.
It was, he said, needless to say how touch
ed he was by the reception. He had hesitated on a count of his inexperience to accept the post, of leader. He believ ed the grand old party would exist as long aa the country exiited. All around h .m were men of great experience in pub*. lie life. He could not too highly expros» ; his appreciation of the kindiKS* extend-ol to him since ins advent into the ti n
of which he was capable to the task.
Many sacrifices were necessary. Business irust be neglected. This interpretation ot motives was inescapable. There compensations, however, not material, but in the feeling that service to the country had been rendered ; also a certain broader light was open to those in
public life in this country. N ne need,	.

If the party changed its views he would bo g! id to hand back the power gran*el to him in February last.
The history of the Conservative party was the history of Canada since and from 18% to the present time no deviation had been made fio n Ihs j rin-plos laid down, in the future these traditions would be maintained. Development would proceed along lines already marked out. Industrial coudrions were changing. Large corporations were looming up. The great railway questions were also coming.

A former member of Remington’s Scouts in South Africa writes to the London Graphic from Johannesburg as follows:
After eight months of British occupation and military government, we do not appear to be much “for-rarder" as far as thc resumption of our ordinary everyday duties and business is concerned. The streets still k«‘ep their bare and deserted appearance; the Reef is still silent; and we still wait and hope. News of any description is a minus quantity' yarns and rumours furnish some subjects for conversation, but as tbe home papers are our only authoritative sources of information, and as we only get them three weeks after publication, the news is somewhat stale.

The author, ill with fever,was im a little settlement of blacks.
