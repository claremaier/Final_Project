How is it to be accounted for ? Nicholas Flood Devin, the author of the article, assigns two causes for it. First Laurier s own extraordinary “ levity of opinion, a ) that it is impossible to know where ho is at. Secondly, the deeds of his friends and colleagues which he sanctions and for which he is therefore responsible,— the sharp and shady transactions ; Cote’s circular to the census othcers ; his circular to the priests of the parish ; the circu ar of the Rojs Government inviting fraud and perjury in order to get at the politics of lads from sixteen to twenty-one ;

contract to purchase 25,000 tons this year at $32.60 a ton, that is $6.60 a ton higher than the present price, and $4.60 higher than the advanced prices ; and to the price there is to be added, if the rails are made in Canada, a bounty of $3 a ton. The arrangement has been the subject of two discussions in Parliament, without any satisfactory explanation being given. There are two grounds of objection stated. One as to the price, the other as to the haste shown in making the contract with a company that as yet has no plant, and without tenders being asked for. Mr. Blair, the minister directly responsible, on neither occasions gave any satisfactory reply to the questions put him, nor did he seem to desire to do so. He is carrying out in Parliament the policy which won him a certain kind of fame when he was head of the New Brunswick administration, of simply depending on the majority behind him to refute all attacks on his methods.
During his time New Brunswick paid more for steel bridges by between 50 and 100 per cent, than other purchasers, acd the knowledge of the fact was all the satisfaction the objecting critics had.
Blair seemingly thinks that what was) for ea good enough for New Brunswick is good enough for Canada. Perhaps the country is fortunate that its loss on this steel rail transation, if it is carried out, will only be between $100,000 and $150,000.
The Blair way of doing things might easily make it double this sum.—Montreal Gazette.
