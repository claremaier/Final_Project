“Mr. D. Gillies, M.F.P., for Pontiac, signed a petition against the best interest of Pontiac, then took tho bush, notwithstanding that the deputation desired him to assist them in their struggle for Pontiac’s benefit. This is the interest that one of our Ontario boys bas for Pontiac fully exempliüei.”
The above is from the editorial columns of the Bryson Advocate last week. So far as wo can learn the inimical document which Mr. Gillies is charged with having signed, was a memorial against the chartering of Mr. Simpson’s colonization road. We are not aware that the local member is justly chargeable with this accusation, and shall not, therefore, express an opinion about it. Anyway, we do not admire the principle of haggling at a man holding a representative position during his term of office, but rather do we prefer to recognize the fact that he is the accepted of the people for a certain term of years, and that their dictum should be respected. At the end of that term, however, when he again comes before the people to render an account of his stewardship, we believe in a close and careful criticism of his record : award credit where credit due and condemn unfaithfulness to duty.
What strikes us most forcibly about tho above extract is the moral contained in the last paragraph thereof. It seems unfortunate our cotem. has been thus late in discovering what would possibly ensue (assuming the charge to be true) from the reprerentation of the county being in tho hands of an “Ontario boy.” This fact constituted one of the chief grounds set up by this journal and the Conservative party in Pontiic against the re-acceptance of Mr. G Hies as our representative. We believed our local candidate was as ful'y qualified to fill the position and much better understood and sympathised with the needs of the people than any outsider could.— But the Advocate strongly maintained otherwise, and, as it transpired, the people agreed with it ; and whether this opinion was due to the promptings of deep-rooted conviction or to the silent but persuasive eloquence of Mr. Gilles’ bank account remains for them to say. If a blunder has been made, nevertheless, we know who is responsible for it. The Conservatives endeavored hard, against overwhelming odds, to prevent contingencies of this kind, but they were snowed under, and having done their duty in that behalf, can now afford to look on complacently and watch the fun.

COST OF ARTIFICIAL MAN. r
A doctor has calculated how much it would cost to make an artificial man. He estimates, we learn from tho Brim tiah Medical Journal," that a pair of arms cost £18, or, with the hands ar^
ticulatcd, about £35, a pair of leg also articulated, cost about £28; false nose Ln metal from £10 to £20 For £20 be believes that he would get a pair of ears just like Nature's handiwork, fitted with artificial ear drums and resonators. A complete set of teeth, with palate in platinum, coat* from £8 to £18, and for a good pair of artificial eyes about £0 would have to be paid. Thus,the total coat of resting a battered veteran wb< has lost most of bis separable part/ would be about £120.
