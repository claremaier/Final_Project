Death from Diphtheria.—Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Hudgins, of the Portage road, mourn the taking away on Tuesday morning of this week, by the dread scourge diphtheria, of one of their children—a promising lad of seven years. The disease is said to have followed an attack of croup, and seems to have developed so rapidly that when medical aid was summoned on Monday little hope remained of saving the child’s life. We sincerely sympathize with the bereaved parents in their loss.

the
The creamery conducted on right principles is one of the beat Êrieinl» of the farmer, and if It can be started it should receive the intelligent support of those who raise the milk and cream for it, says S. W. Chambers.
Too often there is an antagonism between the creamery owners and the farmers, and the latter, to show that they have the power to close the creamery, may very easily destroy a profitable industry in the vicinity.
It certainly pays farmers better to raise their milk and cream for the creamery than for most of the city markets. In these latter places the pries for milk is often so ridiculously small that dairying docs not pay. The remedy often is far farmers to encourage the erection of creameries.
la parts of the West and East where creameries have been established the farmers get more returns from their farms, and are better contented, than In dairying regions where the milk is all shipped to cities.
The cost of making a pound of butter ban been steadily decreased by means of the improved creamery, and it is possible for creameries to make and sell butter at a profit when farmers cannot.

Piers extend out into the river and vessels from Europe tie up at these Iron structures and dischurge their cargoes directly into the little oars that are pulled by steam engines along the main street of Roma.
The peculiarity of this steam tramway is that it makes no charge to any one who desires to ride on it. The entire populace of Borna may travel between the town and the river without paying a cent. Passenger trains however, run only four times a day.
The man on the street corner who desires to hail a train must sometimes find it a rather long time to wait.
Though the passenger service is so infrequent the trains are running about all the time ; for Borna is a very busy place and Royal avenue through which the tramway runs is lined with

Mr mina has bought a calendar,
And every single page	*
Has pictures on of little girls Most just aliout my age.
And when ehe bought it yesterday, Down at the big busier,
She said, " What lovely little girls, How true to life they are.”
Hut 1 don't think they’re true to life, And I'll just tell you why ;
They never have a rumpled frock Or ribbon bow awry.
Ami though they play with cats and dogs
And rabbits and white nnoe,
And sail their boats and fly their kites.
They always look so nice.
And 1 am sure no little girl That ever 1 have seen,
Uould play with dogs or sail a boat And keep her frock so clean.

Mothers are re>|onsible for many cases of crooked legs m little children because they are so anxious to sci Lhe baby walking that they will not wait for its limbs to grow strong enough to support even the slight weight u4 ita body. Then comes the condition known as knock knees or that commonly spoken of as legs.’* Ulten weakness uf the ankle or instep may be attributed to the warns cause.
Now the mother who has made such error may cuusisteutly blame herself (or it and yet doubt whether it is necessary or desirable to have the youngster undergo the nient of an orthopedic hospital.where the expense is bound to be oousid-erabie, and where she is afraid her child will be subjected to experiment, it will be advisable to massage the legs every day, with a view to bringing them back to their shape, and to try all that the shoemaker ¦ art can do in the a#me direction. Shoes especially made to meet all the more common difficulties with children's feet, including these, and are sold at a very slight advance over the prices chargeai tor the average ready made shoe of the same quality. It will pay the young mother to watch carefully the first development of a tendency toward the knock kneed or the

It is said the life of our late Queen will be commemorated in Canada by the passing of a bill at the approaching session of Parliament to make the 24th of May a national holiday for all time to come. In the province of Ontario the Government has already made provision that, following Her Majesty's decease, the celebration of Empire Day by the school children throughout the Province shall funceforth be on the 24*h instead of the 23rd of May, as heretofore.

But the time has come when a delivery of the goods is demanded, and it will be intensely interesting to note what the ; members for Pontiac are going to do about it. Wholesale dismissals of capable officials is not just the easy task which many people seem to imagine. Canadian Governments are not disposed to take their tried employees by the throat at the beck of hungry partisans and turn them out, unless for good and sufficient cause shown. And in the case of Pontiac's officials, this will prove rather an obstinate nut to crack.

When he began his voice was painfully broken with emotion, but he recovered as he went on.
He wore the uuiform of a field marshal and the Order of the Garter.
The Lord Chancellor (Lori Haiebory) adminstered the oath to the King and afterwards to the various members of the council. Commencing with the lords in council, they took their respective oaths of allegiance and then passed in turn before His Majesty as at a levee, except that each paused and kissed hands before passing out of the chamber.
This brought the ceremony to a close. The proclamation of the accession of Hi# Majesty was rgned by the princes present, the Duke of York first, then the duke of Connaught, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Christian, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the j Lord Mayor of London, and the other representatives of the city of London.
The artillery then began firing salutes in St. James Park to signalize King Edward's secession to the throne. His correct title ts “King of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Emperor of India."

Odd rumours get spread on race courses, and in odd ways. A story was. for example, whispered about that Bedford had hit on a splendid piece of roguery—to square the only dangerous horse in the race, to get an outsider to mak* running for him. and to take care just to be beaten, apparently by miscalculation ; and it was aaid that he had £500 starting price on th" winner. Certainly the conversa, tien just quoted seems to give sornv colour to the story.

Another part of nature’s protective mechanism is the fever that occurs with cold. Whenever microbes w iy* invade the body the temperature goes up. The reason is that the chemical activity within the body is greater at the higher temperature tissues live faster for a while and are better able to resist microbe influences.

RE8T THE REST CURE.
For a cold the best thing is rest. If not complete, then, as much as possible. Muscular exertion must not be indulged in while there is fever and the chilliness on exposure to the air that accompanies it. The cough must be stimulated and softened, not treacherously lulled. All the secreting* and excretions the body must N rendered active. They carry off toxic material from the circulation. When inspiration is free, cool sponging and good rubbing should preoeed exposure to the cool air, for the relaxation of the cutaneous tissues brings blood to the surface. This will be chilled, and internal congestions, with complications of the cold, result, unless the little arteries near the surface are stimulated into activity.
