He Shot his Comrade
A despatch from Ottawa to th* Montreal Star under date of Jany 17th says Although the Militia Department has not yet promulgated officially the terms of enlistment in the South Africa police, nor designated the points of enrolment, offers t> join Baden Powell's force have been pouring in by the score. There are individuals volunteering from all over the c luutry, as well as offers to raise men in fifties and hundreds, these latter mostly
from the west have been received from New York and other cities across the line. Yesterday no fewer than fifty tenders of service were received by telegram and letters at the department from various localities. All have been referred to the nearest district headquarters in Canada which will be chosen as points of enrolment. The indications are that three times the one thousand men required could easily be enlisted in Canada. Many of the offers of service are from men who have just returned from the seat of war

He had evidently struggled a good deal as the pipes passing through his room are knocked down and his feet burned. Deceased warn a highly respected and popular young man, unmarried. 29 years ol .

writer are as follows:—“ Some of the boys in A squadron were drilling each other at guard mounting. A young fellow named Scott was acting as instructor. While in the act of looking down the barrel of Reid's rifle the latter accidentally shot Scott, not knowing the rifle was loaded in the chamber. The shot passed Scott s jugular vein, causing death in a very few moments. Reid ie prostrated with grief over the affiir, as is Scott's brother. They all three came from the Regina
