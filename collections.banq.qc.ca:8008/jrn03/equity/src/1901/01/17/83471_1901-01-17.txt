In order to secure the most milk possible during the winter months a great many dairymen keep their sows housed from early fall until late spring, giving them but little if «uy outdoor air and exercise writes Mr. G Jeffry, Now these changed condition* are all right if the change giivtw the cows greater comfort and health. Oui In « srM mpay stables the veatilutBum is decidedly bad and the a ni mu l is day after day laying in u stock of disease germa. For whatever you may do to youi stables and however well you may treat your cows, as to feed and care if ventilati m has been imperfect or neglected it i* sure to result in some form of disease. Circulation and ventilation are inseparable and indispensable to perfect health. No ventilation is good that does not carry the foul air out of the stable and supply fresh and wholesome air in its stead. The air of the stable should never be exhausted or vitiated If the ventilators do not oommuni-
