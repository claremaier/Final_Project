There has yet to be a remedy discovered that is so prompt and thorough in Curing intestinal indigestion as Dr. Chase’s Kidney-Liver Pills. And as this is the most common and ere form of indigestion, it can well be claimed that Dr. Chase’s Kidney-Liver PU la are the most successful treatment extant for indigestion and dyspepsia.
It is not unusual for persons who have long been suffering from chronic indigestion, biliousness and stipation to be thoroughly cured by Dr. Chase’s Kidney-Liver Pills .whicli have by far the largest sals of any similar remedy.

It frequently (happens that people who continually done the stomach for indigestion and use pepsin and various kinds of digestive tablets and powders can obtain no relief from r.uch treatment, because the real trouble is in tbo intestines, the liver T | and the kidneys.
There is fullness and pains after meals, coated tongue, headache, loss )f appetite, pains in the limbs and m the hack and shoulders, flatulency ind constipation, frequently alternating with diarrhoea.

Another batch of supplementary esti. mates were brought down by the Finance Minister on Tuesday of last week. They amount to the snug little sum of $3,729,-?lt>, and bring up the total estimated expenditure for current year to $t>0,4(>0, • SOI, No doubt further estimates will bo brought down before the session closes, and we hope, while the contents of the government chest are being dealt out with auoh lavish hand, our astute M. P. will see to it that Pontiac gets a share of the spoils. For instance, Shaw ville should have a post office. If the amount of bus-alness done is a consideration, it has certainly as good a claim to one as several other places that have been so provided.
If some of our local Liberal# who have the “pull” would interest themselves in matters of this kind, instead of con -•piriug to remove the heads of competent officials, they would be doing something that would redound much to their credit, and at the same 'time be of public ad vantage.
While we are passing through the delightful experience of Mr. Fielding’s ••growing time,” Pontiac should make a vigorous effort to be in the swim. A reaction will come just as surely as night succeeds day, and then

the track. Some of the spectators turn ed away horrified. However, he got his legs off the track in a jiffy, hugging the platform close, and would have come off unscathed but that the wheels caught hi# coattail and the portion of his pints used to sit down on and destroyed them. At the critical moment Mr. W. R. Dickson, operator, happened to be clore at hand, and, running in and holding Led-gerwood clear of danger until the train atopped, saved hi# life. It was a thrilling occurrence, and the promptitude and presence of mind shewn by Mr. Dickson was applauded by those who were eyewitnesses.

It is only a shilling extra. — He showed the farmer the apparatus for administering gas, remarking that it would cause him to fall aileop tor a minute, and before he awoke the tooth would be out.

Mutchmor had been working in the Brockville carriage works for • short time, and was about to take the train for Gananoque.

He caught hold of the railing of a car platform, but lost hold, and in a moment was under the wheels, which passed over his neck, severing the head from the body. He was 30 years of age.

New York, April 11.—At the conclusion of his sermon on Easter Sunday Dr. Huntington, pastor of Grace Church, pointed out that the church was badly in need of more buildings, for which it had the ground on Fourth avenue in the rear of the present structure. Great was his surprise on Easter Sunday, after the usual Suiidiy offering had been collected, to find that the collection boxes held $107, 000. This prompt response to his request was a most pleasant surprise to Dr-Huntington, and is said to be the largest amount ever taken in the collection boxes of a church in one day.

A careful review of the company's business fer the past six years was made by Prof. Dr.
James Mills, In which he showed that, while in ISUl the assets cf the company amounted to 18*21,321. they now have reached the large figures of 12.270.176. As an indication of their excellent character, only some $600 of overdue interest rxleted on the3Ut December lo respect cf the whole of them. The expenses fer ?ovoral years past have shown a gradual decrease, and In 1900 the chairman stated that ,bi ratio of expenses was about 14 ner cent let* than it was two years ago. In every impo. tint particular, as pointed out by Mr. K.

The cash income increased by over $81 000: the assets by over $169 0 0; the policy rnerve by over $:t a 000 : surplus on policyholders' account by over 1339 010 : and the Insurance in force by over $1.000,000.
