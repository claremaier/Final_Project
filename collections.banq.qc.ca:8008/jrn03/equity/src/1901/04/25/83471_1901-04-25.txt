Expensive Immigrants.
The immigration returns brought down this year show that the amount of money being spent by the Government for this
purpose is out of all reasonable proportion to the results that have been attained by way of increase in the number of people that have come into the country, without taking into account the undesirable character of a large number of them. This is shown very clearly by way of comparison with the previous year's record. Thus in 189:) the number of immigrant» was 44,543, costing @255,878 88; in 1900 43,097, costing $434,502 6*. Increase in immigrants, 154; increase in cost, $178, 083.73. Each one of the 154 therefore cost the respectable sum of $1,160 25.,

toed by the Feberal Cabinet, on the ground that it is ultra vires. The British North America Act fixes the life of the Provincial Legislature?, but allows for an amendment. It is argued, however, that the act recantly passed is not an amendment within the provisions and meaning of the B N. A. act, Insomuch as it does not extend the life of the Legislature for all time for some good and sufficient reason given, but only extends it for one term in order to avoid conditions that may never occur again. There appears little doubt but that if the extension were made for a lasting arrangement, and for good reasons given the act would be intra vires, but it is argued that the present act might be made a precedent, if at any time a provincial government were desirous of avoiding meeting the electors, which would evidently be contrary to the principles of British traditions, and in opposition to the spirit of the B. N. A. act.

The rumoured transfer of Judge La-vergne is giving rise to considerable speculation as to who will be his successor as judge of the superior court in Hull and in the counties of Ottawa, Libelle and Pont ire. In this connection it is stated that the vacancy will be filled by the elevation to the bench of Mr. N. A. Belcourt, M.P.
