The Railway employee’s excursion committee Jiave made arrang-mente to run two excursion trains to Coulonge on Dominion Day. The first train will leave Ottawa about 8 a. nt., and is intended to take all the excursionists along the line between Aylmer and Coulonge. It will bo duo at Shawvillo about 10 o'clock.-The second train will leave Ottawa about 9 o’c'ock a m.; and will not stop at intermediate points, it will carry the Ottawa and Gatineau excursionists, the object being to give those people coming from a long distance as quick and unwearying a journey to Coulonge as posai Me.

Halifax, N. S., June 10.—Great Bri-1,dn has her eye on France, and is meeting her at every turn. It was announced some time ago that Franco was sending a large number of men to St. Pierre? and it Wi»j stated that the men were to undergo a course of training on a war vessel to be stationed there. It will be interesting to know that Britain has de-•sided to send the training ship Calypso j to Argentic Bay. It wa§ the inter t oo to station the Cliypeo at St John’s, Nfl.j., bu; the order has been countermanded,
and the Cltypio will g> to Argentic
Bay.
qwb baa been received hero that Ar 'gentic Bay will made a naval station and I that forts will be erected there and dockyard established. This report Ins been confirmed and work will #jon be
commenced.

physicians who have cases of this disease in many instances fail or refuse to report them. But the number reported is sufficiently large to occasion some alarm. Seventy-four of the known cases are in New Orleans, chiefly among the Italian population. There are twenty-three in Minnesota, mostly among Scandinavians in the rural settlements. There are fifteen cases in North Dakota, and two in South Dakota, among the same people. So far as has been ascertained, there are none in Michigan or Indiana; Chicago has five cases.

Corning down to more recent times, we find that the lato Queen Victoria in 1898 killed Mr. Robert Taylor when he was a hundred and thirty-four by «ending hi!n her picture signed by hureelf. Tho old telldwi was so delighted that he died from emotion. An Irishman named Brown who lived to l*e a hundred and twenty was an habitual drunkard. So was the Frenchman, Eapagnac, who died at th) ago of a hundred and twelve. He hid a daily "jag" for ninety year* Durand d’ EUtivel of Cahors attributed hi* hundred and twenty-eight years to taking an occasional dose of gunpowder instead of castor oil. A woman of a hundred and twenty-four olaimied that her groat ago was due to strong coffee imbibed in great quantities. A man of one hundred and* fourteen years rarely ate anything except fruit, principally melons and he constantly chewed lemon pool. Now tot up all those queer contradictions and find the right rescrip-tioo for longevity. The conclusion will probably b? that, if man Is a free agent, he «hemId be careful in tho selection of his parent».

The figures now compiling represent a great deal of careful work. A circular was sent from Washington hP every city and country physician, every health officer, every responsible head of a hospital in the country. It called for volunteer information covering cases of leprosy in the community in question; tho name of the leprous person, the sex, age. social condition whether town or country—and name of attending physician. In all, 8,000 of these letters have gone out; replies have thus far been received from only 2,000 of them may be several times 275 cases in the 6,000 districts from which thus far no replies have come.
It is the intention of those who are compiling the figures to make a report to Congress, including such recommendations as may seem warranted. One recommendation will be for tho erection of two large Government hospitals for lepers, one in th| south and the other in the north. Eminent physicians have at different times been before committees of Congress in tho interest of the erection of leper hospitals, but nothing came of these visits, the Government, having no reliable data covering the prevalence of the disease. Next winter, however, with full information on tho subject, it is believed that Congress will act promptly.
It is noteworthy that nearly all the 275 reported victims arc foreigners. Tho Scandinavians seem peculiarly susceptible to the disease. They cither had it when they landed in America, or contracted it soon after landing. Every one of the cases in the Dakotas and Minnesota is in the
