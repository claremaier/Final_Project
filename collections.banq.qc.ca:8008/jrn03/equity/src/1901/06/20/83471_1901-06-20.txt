About a fear ago, when the atock of the Dowd Milting Company was placed un the mirket the task of disposing of it was found to bo one of rather a diffi cu'.ty character. Those having capital to invest evinced a chariness about touching the enterprise which was anything but encouraging to the promoters ; but the latter persevered and succeeded in disposing of $.">0,000 worth of shares, representing half of the capital stock of the Co Ov per cent, of winch amount was paid up. With these funds at its disposal the efficient management undertook the tirât year’s operations, and that those efforts have been singularly successful is amply shown by the financial report published a short time ago. That report must certainly be a source of must gratification to those who had faith in the enterprise, as it must also bring disappointment to those who went out of their way to throw cold water upon it. The very healthy condition in which the company has emerged from its first year’s operation appears to have . made a marked change in public senti* ment, if we are to judge from the reports | F Of made last week by Mr. T. Ei. Brownlee, agent for the company, and Mr. E. Ora* ham, one the directors. These gentlemen rjpo:t that in a throe-days^tour of Bristol township they succeeded in disposing of one thousand shares, valued at $10,000, or 1-fifth of the company's remaining atock, and they were enabled to do so without difficulty, especially to those who bought last year, and who have received their 10 per cent, dividend on the paid up atock of the investment then made.
It may be stated without desire to flatter that the very crditable showing which I 14 THE 2 TAILORS’1 the company has thus made is due in the __ .	_	_
main to the keen business tact and ! jü&lH StTOOt, Sal3,W"V1118.
shrewd financing of the manager, Mr. H. ---------
Dowd. Jo realize this comparatively p Q TS large dividend of ten per cent., in addi- 1 * w ” lion to making provision for other contingencies, Mr. Dowd did a business of nearly a quarter million dollars in eleven months time. Besides the dividend mentioned $3,000 was set aside to offset the depreciation in value of plant, and $1,000 was written vff for possible bad debts, whilst a sufficient •sum was placed in reserve to guarantee a 10 per cent, dividend next year, in the event of profits falling off.
It is the intention of the company to dispose of the balance of its stock at once,
• id wo ie .tare the opinit n if Mr. Brownlee's succtst Jin sellivg it continues o i the lines of his recent experience in Bristol, only a few weeks will elapse before

our advice worth	we
would recommend taking pattern from their Bristol neighbors, those canny Scots, who noted for their shrewdness, are not slow to catch on to a sure thing when it presents itself.
It must be remembered that the Dowd Milling Company is a county enterprise, and as such is entitled to encouragement and support. It affords a safe investment for capital that is not otherwise invested,
* and besides provides a local market for every surplus bushel of oats that can be produced »n the county. With the cooperation of the farmers of Pontiac, ensuring its continued success, we see no reason to doubt that under the present directorate the stock of the company will vastly increase in value in the course of a very few years.
