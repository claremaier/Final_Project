holding against tho world, ing are the tragédie» whichl have resulted from invasion of the spot. Some men who had jin wittingly disturbed the bec» were set upon! by stinging millions, and plunged into the river. But every time they showed their heads above water, the insects settled upon them in clouds, and they chose drowning to a more hideous
death. Doer, pigs and lordly tiger, have paid the, same, penalty for their indiscretion. ! Englishman who describes the spot:
1 determined to invade the home of the bees, and I began by designing a
suit of defensive armor, sort of overall suit, tied round neck with tape, a bee veil to be tucked into the garment, riding-bools, gauntlets and two pairs of gloves. Into this suit I was sewn by the tailor, so that there should be no chink or crevice.
Abram, n nitivo, and I, armored and carrying a bucket and two coils of rope, were to climb up to the back of the hills so as to get above the bees, and Percy, who was in charge of the boat, Ascended tho rocks. He went to tho bank of the’ river,, which was under the point of attack, and made his boat fast.
Abram and I climbed to & well-considered height, and then I left him and crawled cautirusly forward. I could b ar a sort of all-pervading hum, dominating even the roar of tho water beneath, and my nostrils were filled with that sweet smell which, is made up of honey, war undi bee.
I decided that the point of attack was about a hundred yards farther on ; so I returned for Abram, and together we made our way there. The cliff was sheer, and even overhanging.

But now a German scientist bai» come forward with some still more startling facts concerning the journey* which our eyelid undertakes every time It winks, and It Is not possible foi uu to see, be says, unless we wink Unconsciously we wink once a second, so that for the time we are awake dur ing the day we voluntarily wink from 48,000 to 60,000 times and in a yea: have moved our eyelids down and up again no less than 18,250,000 times. The distance that the eyelid travels In its great speed Is measured from a single Involuntary wink.
This, the scientist says, Is a quarter of an inch both ways, the eyelid mov lng equally up and down, so that, tak ing the movement of both eyelids Into consideration, they cover some 60,00< inches In n day. The eyelids of a mar who has lived for 50 years will hare unconsciously traveled a third of tb« way around the earth, or about 7,200 miles, a calculation sufficient In Itself to cause the victim of lusomnia to fall into a dreamless sleep as he reads lt -London Mail

I put one end of the rope round a tree growing at tho edge of the cliff, gave the other end to Abram* and went over. I found I should have to get a swing to reach the ledge on which I meant to stand. Hanging i wn on this ledgo from above was
teS or fifteen feet of comb.
I reached the rock with my hand, gave a push, swung out, then in again, struck in the middle of the comb, and gained my feet with a scramble.
The bees were iy>on me. Tho air reeked with that curious acrid smell familiar to those who have been stung. The noise of the water below was drowned by the hiss of the angry bees. I was completely blinded, for they had swarmed over my veil,, blocking out the light. Whem I touched mv body it seemed to me, through m> glove, that I was covered by thick, soft fur, all bees.
For a few moments 1 was stupefied, frightened. Then I realized that my armor was trustworthy, and that I was safe. Abram lowered the bucket, and blindly I felt about for the comb, and as well as I could, scraped it into the bucket. I lowered it to Percy and shouted to Abram to lower me. (He told me afterward that he could not see me. In the place where he knew I must be w as nothing but a brown, whirling mass.
I swung out into the dark, bumping as I went. At last a man clutched me, and I knew I was at the bottom. I brushed the bees from my veil, and through a driving mist of them saw a cluster of other bees in the shape of a man. This was Percy.
Wo cut curatives adrift and rowed to a convenient place, where we made for tho shore. There, five miles away, we nude a sulphur smoke and were freed from the last of our enemies.

A Dead Face In the Window.
Crock ford, the proprietor of a well known London gambling house, was made to play a queer role after he warn dead. When one of Crockford’s horses was poisoned just before the Derby, the misfortune brought on an attack of apoplexy, which proved fatal within 48 hours. Now, many of Crock ford's friends had staked large sums ou another of the gambler's horses, which was n favorite for the Oaks and which was disqualified by the death of the owner. Only the people In the gambling bouse knew of Crockford's death, and it was resolved to keep It a secret until after the race.
Tho servants were bribed and sworn to secrecy, and the conspirators on the day after the night upon which Crockford died had tho body placed In a chair at a window, so that people returning from the track could see the gambler sitting there. He was fixed up to look as lifelike as possible and through the window and partially concealed from view by the curtains looked so natural that no one of the great crowd which came cheering by the house when on their return from seeing Crockford's horse win the Oaks suspected the trick.
The next day It was announced that Crockford was dead, but It was years before the true story leaked out.

Judging by the proceedings in the Senate on Tuesday it id evident that th® g<'x-uroment is not very anxious for an investigation being n;ade as to the anthenticnees of the Cook charges. And the emphatic denial given last year by Sir Wilfrid Laurier “for himself and his colleagues/’ that the statement unde by Mr. Cook vras false, ia very significant, now that Mr. Mills and Mr. Scott are opposeUo making an inveitigstiou. Therefore Sir Wilfrid did not have the authority of bn .clteaguea to state that there was no truth in the chargee, because if he had his ministers would not have objected to investigation being made. An honest Government would have come out and agreed to investigate the charges to the fullest extent.

Learning that Mr. Murray was anxious to redeem his pre-election pledges in the matter of procuring some measure ol relief from the bonus, the council instructed the Warden to prepare a memorial to the government, setting forth the grievances of the county in this behalf, and thus afford the member for the Com* nions au opportunity to put his influence with the powers that be to the test.
A resolution was a'*# passed petition ing the Government for aid towards the completion of the V. P.J. Railway from its present terminus at Waltham, and also lor the promised extension from Shaw ville to Pembroke via Calumet Island
The Secretary Treasurer made compKint that he was nut supplied w ith a proper office room for earning on tho business of the council, and also of r lie unsafe condition of tins records without a vault wherein to store them. This brought up the question of erecting a county ball at Bryson. But 4 lion, members were not prepared t" dispose of so important a question off-hand, ami the question was promptly shelved till next meeting.
The estimate" for the year’s expenditure, which required the sum of $1,500, were provided for by a rate of OOOo on the dollar—the same as last year, after which the council adjourned.

The explanation of the Warden as one of the committee who purchased the stone crusher evoked considerable discussion. mainly on the point respecting the terms on which municipalités would he permitted to use it. It finally took the torn of a resolution to charge a rate of $1 per day ; an amendment was propos t'd to make the fee $3 and a sub amendment asked to have the machine made absolutely free to every municipality requiring its use. The main motion, however, carried. The machine will be unloaded at Quyon station and will first he operated in that municipality, then it may to South Onslow, if Mayor Kennedy can induce his council to commence the work of permanent -road -making in that municipality; then it will likely travel upwards through the county as required.
