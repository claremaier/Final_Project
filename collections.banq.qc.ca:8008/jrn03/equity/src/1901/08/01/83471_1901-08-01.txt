Doth sheep and hogs most greedily devour the fallen fruit, whether it contains worms or is decayed, llogs will eat all fallen fruits from cherries to apples, while sheep are fond of apples. There is some risk in allowing cattle the range of an apple orchard after the fruit is nearly developed as they are often choked by attempting to swallow whole apples. If the trees are trained low they will pull the fruit from the lower branches and in a playful mood, hook the limbs and trunks. Horses and colts will also pull the fruit from the trees, and if disposed can reach some distance from the ground.
Pasturing orchards, whether recently set or old and well developed, ic attended with many risks, in most cases not commensurate with the supposed gain. If orchards were planted with hoed crops, or kept.

St. Mary’s, N. B., July 22— (Special ).—Thomas Harrison of this place considers himself a fortunate man that he is alive and well today. For months he was suffering, everybody thought, with appendicitis. That's what he was told and that’s what he was being treated for. But he grew worse in spite of tho efforts exerted to help him.
In appendicitis it is generally thought necessary to perform an operation. That Mr. Harrison was not required to undergo the surgeon’s

THOUSANDS OF MILES OF WIRE
FENCES.
The sheep farms of tho past were merely wild lands, whore the flocks, watched by shepherds, were grazed on the hills and valley*. These big stations of Australia are actual farms. The land is divided up into great fields or paddocks, fenced witt smooth wire, except along the roads where barbed wire Is used average paddock contain* 800 acres, but there are many which arc larger. Some contain several thousand acres, and single paddocks have from 2,000 to 20,000 sheep. Col. Dell tells me of ono station ho visited which had enough wire fencing to wall one side of a road from New York to San Francisco and enough people to form a good sized town. I have travelled through other stations which are larger, and I am amazed at tho vast extent of tho fencing and the enormous cost of running the ranches.

ers
At present In this state of New South Wales 40,000,000 out of tho 41,000,000 sheep which are here owned are kept in fenced paddocks There are thousands of miles of wire netting put up as fencing to keep out the rabbits. There ore millions of dollars invested in buildings, and the salary list of a great station is as long us that of a department store. Sheep raising is by no means n cheap business, and to make it pay everything must be carefully managed.
The average sheep farm costs from $15,000 to $20,000 a year to run it, and there arc some in which tho expenses run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Of late wages have steadily increased, until the men arc now paid about $5 a week with board. Every man receives weekly about twelve pounds of meat, ten pounds of flour and a \ quarter of a pound of tea, as well as other things, so that every station must keep a large store and warehouse. Even the smaller stations have a dozen or more men in ordinary times, and in shearing times the hands arc numbered by scores.
Tho land in the better parts of Australia is valuable, and even where it is rented of the Government it runs rapidly into money. Tho leases are different in the different states, the price in Queensland being from to $8 per square mile per annum.
1 know of one man who has 240,000 acres in Queensland for which he pays only half a cent per acre per | year, but even at this rate it foots i up to $1,200, and there are farms j which pay rents of tens of thou- i sands of dollars.

The people are more careful ns to matters of etiquette than in the cities. It is the usual thing to dress for dinner, and, although there may not bo a stranger within fifty miles, the men will appear night after night in evening suits, and tho ladies in decollete dresses, while the servants who wait upon they are in livery. In travelling through the country here every gentleman carries a dress suit with him. If he goes away from tho railroad he usually has an extra horse for his baggage, or lie may take his boiled shirts and store clothes in saddle bags on tho back of his horse. The people arc the soul of hospitality, and it is taken for granted that whenever you call you will be asked to stay.
The social life on these big Australian farms is largely made up of parties and dances and afternoon teas. It is not an uncommon thing for a young man or young woman to ride or drive five, ten or fifteen miles to take a cup of tea with a friend. At the dances people will come forty and fifty miles, riding all day to get to the place of festivity, dancing all night and then starting back home as the day breaks.
The Australians are fond of racing, and there are tracks coi.iiucted with

Why Buffalo Gets the Grain
Trade.
The reason that Buffalo can continue to successfully compete with the special all water route for grain to the seaboard is that the cheap transportation by the wateu-and rail route has kept ahead of the deepening of the can ils. We have seen that in the last decade a notable re duction in transportation rates had taken place both on railways and ships. The factors that have contributed to tlus are size and time. In the case of railways the trucks have been made to cairy nearly three times the amount they used to do, and the more powerful engines take at
least twice the trainload. On the lakes' Qualified Protestant Teacher for Aid the sizes of the steamers have increased 1	1	/" l‘0mnu‘ui t‘
