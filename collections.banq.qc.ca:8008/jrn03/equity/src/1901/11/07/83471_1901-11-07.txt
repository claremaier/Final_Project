J he construction of this Plow is such that all dragging on the ground -or against the land is done away with, and as l result, even with a heavy driver, its draught is lighter than any ether plow doing the same work. The width and depth
of the furrow can be regulated with certainty by the driver
without his getting off' the plow and without interfering with the management of the team.
