Manitoba Premier Declines to
Re-open the School Issue.
% '
Winnipeg. Man., June 20.—Two weeks ago the members of the Winnipeg Catholic schools committee waited on Premier Macdonald and asked him to bring in legislation for the relief of the Catholics in the matter of education. Under date of Juno 13, the Premier has written a letter to P. Marin secretary of the committe in which he says it will be impossible for the government to meet the wishes of the delegation. The position assumed by his party during the last election was that this matter, having been settled as announced by Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Hon. Mr. Greenway, should not bo disturbed, and having taken this position, it is difficult for him to see how his (Macdonald's) government, can properly move m the direction desired. On receipt of this letter, a meeting of the committee was held, and it was decided at once to put the matter before the Dominion authorities.

London, June 23, 3 40 a m.—General Steyn’s forces in the Orange River Colony are for the time drawing most of the attention tf Lud Roberts, rather to the neglect of Commandant Gen. L ouis Bjtha and President Kruger. The severance betwien the Transvaal and Orange River Colony was completed yesterday, as Lord Roberti said it would be, by the arrival of General Bullet's advance, under Lord Dundonald at Standerton. The wide net around the (>,000 or 8,000 men under Steyn will now contract. Adroit ma-noeuveringand brisk fighting are likely to tako place, because until all resistance south of the Vaal is at an end, the British line of communication wi 1 not be safe.

The way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon n rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the eca, and the way of a man with maid.” If you would know what this great man thought about good women, just read hia last chapter of Proverbe. While he takes many times to plane himself on record ae not favouring equal rights, perhaps woman was never better appreciated or given a more beautiful tribute than in this chapter.
There is little need to speak of the many instances in which even the greatest prophets fall before the power of women. The accounts are familiar to every one.
Women do nut have io go back into ancient history to prove their ability lo suffer the hardships of soldiers In camp and on the battlefield. The Red Cross nurses in this day and generation are quite sufficient proof of this fact. But it is also true that woman h is always been this way, and has always begged for the privilege of being at her husband's side, and In cases where she has been favored the instances are few indeed where
