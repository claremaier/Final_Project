Wire of all kinds, and in fact everything made of iron, has been steadily advancing
in price during the past year. Some time ago we secured a car-load of Barb Wire at
a price much lower than present quotations, and we are offering the same at a
very small advance on cost to present buyers. Do you want any before price goes up.

The principle of imposing heavy stum-page dues with the effect of prohibiting the exportation of pulp wood from Canada is all right, but narrowed down to the lines proposed to be adopted by the Quebec Government, which practically prohibits this commodity from being taken from this province and sent into other parts of the Dominion, seems a singularly exclusive piece of business to emanuate from a Liberal Government.
THE EXiilNEEK S OPINION.
From the brief study uf the plans which Mr. Mackenzie has been enabled to make since his arnval, he feels quite satisfied of the feasibility of the great scheme. He says he considers it far more practical, and gives more promise of success than did the Nicaragua canal project. In fact he has every faith in our canal project and will at once undeitake an exhaustive study of

At eight o’clock last evening the jury in the case of Aichibald, tutor for his minor nephew, Hector McArthur, for $10,uo0 damages against the Dominion Cartridge Company, for injuries received in an explosion at the company’s factory at Brownsburg, Argenteuil County, brought in a verdict awarding the plaintiff $’>,000 damages. Mr. Justice Davidson, who presided, addressed the jury on law points for about half an hour. Messrs. Harvey and Hutchins acted for the plaintiff, and Messrs. F.eet and Macmaster for the company. The jury replied in the affirmative that the company was responsible for the accident in neglecting to provide suitable machinery, and in not taking proper precautions to prevent an explosion.

Proposal to Abolish County Councils Discussed in the Legislature
Parkman
The censure that has been so freely bes towed on the War Office should be somewhat checked by the statements of Mr. Wyndham, the parliamentary secretary. Since the war began, he showed, there have been sent to South Africa over 14-V 000 soldiers, with 340 pieces of artillery, ranging from horse guns to howitzers. And there are more on the way other British Government ever accomplished such a task at such a time; and not only were the men sent, but they were well provisioned and such arrangements made for their care, well or sick, as have never been surpassed. All this will have its effect in time and as it tells the unrestrained critics will subside.— Montreal Gazette.

Prompt attention to business disappointments to patrons.
The question of the utility of County Councils was brought before the House last Thursday by the following resolution, moved by Mr. Blanchaid : " That in the opinion of the House, it is e xpedient to abohah county councils and to replace them in the following manner :	1 —As
regards the determination of differences arising between local municipalities ; by •rbitrators appointed by the municipalities interested ; 2 —As regards the sale of immoveables for taxes and assessments, by the local council; B —As regards county purposes : by three delegates elected annually by the councils of the local municipalities of the county.’ Mr. Blanchard spoke in support of his motion, and was followed by Mr. Kobidoux, who, while warmly congratulating him upon the study he had given the question and the clear manner in which he had expressed his views, suggested that the House could scarcely yet be supposed to be in a position to vote upon a matter of such great importance, and moved that the resolution be referred to the special committee of the House upon the Municipal Code.

These were those of the mover and seconder above noted; Sir Charles Tapper’s reply, in which h? strongly arraigned the Government on its conduct with reference to the dispatch of our troops to Africa; the Premier s brilliant if not logical defence, Hon.

The mule used flor the mountain
artillery iu the Transvaal has «pevial
training for stability. It i* hw duty

Each half u> entrused to a inuie, and the two parts are joined together in a second. The carriage is brought on the hack of another mule and others bring the ammunition.
The mule has in a u y advantages over the hutve iu the present campaign, w pecially because he hast the reputation of being able to hang ou to a precipitous pathway where u horse could not be made to venture. Except in mountain climbing, he carries ordinarily about 100 lbs, although, if well fed, he sometimes can take 5)0 pounds. He not only is much freer» from dia-ivinc than the horse, but his akin is so; much thicker that the pestiferous African insects cannot make life an additional burden to him. Uo n-n't half so fussy as a home about what he eats or drinks. His usual rations in South Alricn are 10 pounds of grain or L0 pounds of oat hay, with half an curve of rock salt; that, however, is when times are good, and if he has to work nlong on short rations hw is as cheerful and contented about it as possible. Put blinkers on him, and have a white horse to lead the procession, and he will go anywhere.
HOUSEHOLD.
Madrid gossip, if founded on fact, would appear to show that Spain may soon hive a monarch who would recall the third and the fourth Philip. This would not only be a misfortune and a humiliation for Spain, but would be a source of regret to the world. Spain has, since the close of the war of 18118, shown a poise and general sanity, coupled with a recuperative power, which have been a surprise and gratification to the world. It would be a calamity for that country should the stories about the mental incapacity of its future ruler he true. If they should be true, the laws of heredity In this particular instance would to be strangely violated Alfonso XII., the father of the incoming King, was decidedly creditable monarch
the ablest man who has been on the Spanish throne since the death of Charles II!., over a century ago, unless an exception be made in the case of the unfortunate Amadeus brother of the present King of Italy, who abdicated after a brief reign. His mother, too, the present Regent, is n woman of high mental and moral character, who, in the peculiarly delicate situation in which she has been placed, In recent years, has performed her part with rare dignity and intelligence. More than at any other period since Najxdeon I. dethroned Ferdinand VII. and put Joseph Bonaparte in his place Spain now needs a ruler of tact and balance.

TREATMENT OF NEURALGIA.
Pain in a nerve may be due to many causes, such as inflammation of tins nerve itself or of the parts around it, pressure by a tumor or swelling somewhere along the course of the nerve, disease at the point of origin of the nerve in the brain or apinaJ; cord, and the like.
When no cause can be discovered for the pain it is called neuralgia; but the term is becoming more and more rest rioted in its application as medical science advances and new means of detecting disease in formerly inaccessible parts of the body are devis-

The pain is intermittent in character; that is to say, attacks of pain alternate with pain-free periods. The duration of the attacks us well as of the intervals between them, varies from a few hours to days or even weeks.
Children do not, as a rule, suffer from neuralgia in any# part of the body ; they may have dieauaches, it is true, but those are usually due to eyestrain or to some distinct nervous trouble.
The pain of neuralgia is usually very acute and cutting, and is constantly varying in intensity, now( dying down f(ur a i one, so as to be# scarce,y noticeable, and again becoming almost unendurable, slabbing the poor sufferer with ferocious malignity.
The character of the pain serves to distinguish neuralgia from so-called muscular rheumatism, the pa n uf which is a steady dull ache rather than a sharp, boring and paroxysmal agony.
There is a curious form of neuralgia which is called "reminiscent.11 It occurs in pei alts, usually*» ot a nervous type, who have suffered from they would be surprised at the fuel nerve-pain, due to inflammation,, the	wouj<j

By the death of John Buskin, English art and letters lost the inspiration and the animating impulse of the most powerful literary exponent of that modern school of art which came to be known by the name of pre-Ralphaeli\ism tersely expressed it, the aim of this school was to "paint things as they probably did look and happen, and not as, by rules of art developed under Raphael, they might be supposed gracefully, deliciously, or sublimely to have happened." The more prominent among the earlier pre-Raphaelites were William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Ford Madox Brown, and Dante Gabriel Rosetti.

Lord Methuen's campaign and the siege of Ladysmith, to say nothing of Mafekmg mid Kimbei ey, show the wisdom of Nos. 3 and 0. w hile both Lord Methuen and General Gat-acre could bear witness to Nos. 11 and
13	as sound military doctrine. Nos.
14	is notoriously true. No. 15, if not already demonstrated, would appear not incapable of demonstration, while General Duller seems to have grasped the fact that No. 17 now points to the only means by which the British cam bent their way north to the in-trenichments of Pretoria. Altogether it would be hard to discover just such another instance of cool, prevision as that shown by thief extraordinary M.
