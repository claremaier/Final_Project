TORPEDO BOATS.
Secret Jraloanly iieerded hy Official* la Charge of Ihe Service.
In no department of service under any Government—even th e Foreign Office is not excepted by naval men— are there so many secrets to preserve as in the torpedo service ; and with such absolute exactitude is every article connected with torpedo stores kepi ih it men have been rem ve I from employment and reduced in rank because a single common iron bolt—of course, of a particular kind—worth the minutest fracti been missing.
Just at this time England is unusually strict. Every pattern of tool, bolt, pin, screw, spanner, wheel or cog has Its own separate locker at the great depot at Portsmouth, where there are always 1,000 torpedoes of the latest kind, worth about 1^,500,000 as to mere prime cost. Every Item must be produced on demand notice. On one occasion, when the stocktaking took place/ It was found that instead of 5,000 little screws— these particular screws cost 5cents a gross—being accounted for by the man who was told off to count them there were only 4,997. An animated correspondence took place about these three screws, and certain important changes were made in the department through theiit loss.
The incident cited in a Government handbook, distributed among torpedo officers and men alone, to convince them# of the importance of not losing sight of a single object that, could give a nlew to certain se-erete. When a torpedo# is from any broken up every part of It Is separately melted or crushed to pieces, and this In the presence of an official whe can declare that he personally
