\N hat ever the factory separator wastes in f skimming, in its effect upon the thorough i chuinability of the cream, or in impair- 1 ment of quality of product, must necessarily fall upon the patrons.

The news of the Hull conflagration caused dismay here, as a good many have relatives and acquaintances there. The reflection of the tire was seen from here Thursday evening.

The number of those supposed to have lost their lives in the fire is variously es timated from 12 to 18 persons ¦¦¦¦ ber aie missing and several have since died from injuries and the effects of the shock.
The E. B. Eidy Company, whose losses from the fire have been particularly heavy, have commenced this week with a large force of men to clear away the wreck of tangled and twisted machinery, preparatory to commencing building op erations again.
Thousands of people from all over the country visited the fire swept district Sunday.
By the great fire in St. John, N. B. in 1877. nearly 20,000 people were rendered homeless and property to the value of $22,000,000destroyed. The Ottawa fire noon, dally, Sundays included if not so great was a close second.	—

ly exists deep down in the earth from completely liquefying the material on which it works. No. 6 from a pressure which overcomes completely the liquefying power even of the maximum heat of the interior. This pressure is estimated tr> be, at the center ni the earth, 7,180,593,750 pounds to the square foot—a pressure so enormous that no known substance could fuse beneath it. Even hydrogen at the highest possible temperature would, under such conditions, become as herd as a diamond. Hence it seems probable that far from there being a vacuum at the center of the earth, there is a mass of intensely solidified matter there.

Bangkok, Siam, is probably the most up-io-date city in the East. As a result of" the gradual improvement of the streets of the city during the last ten years, very many vehicles of all descriptions are used. The extent of the city makes travel by carriage almost a necessity ; hence, Bangkok is a long way ahead of any other city in the fax East in the use of wheeled vehicles. The demand was at first supplied principally from outside sources, i but of late a local industry has been
springing up, and 90 per cent, of the carriages in use are now manufactured in Bangkok. Without exception, however, they strike the stranger as unnecessarily heavy and clumsy streets of the city are perfectly level, no point for miles around being more I than three feet above high-water mark and, being built of macadam, are most adaptable to the use of light-running vehicles of all kinds. Moreover, the native ponies, which have proved themselves best fitted to stand the trying climate, are very small, weighing only from 500 to 700 pounds, and hardly suitable for the heavy vehicles. But these little animals are used so exclusively that there are not more than 90 full-sized horses in t be city. In view of these conditions, it would seem that the different styles of light-running vehicles would prove very desirable if once introduced. The workmanship and material must be first-class to meet the climate, which changes very quickly frotn extremely wet to hot and dry; but if well mode, there is no doubt that

The relief of Colonel Dalgevy was accomplished by General Brabant.
The Boers have everywhere retired at the first pressure of the British advance, and the hope that General Bundle would be able to induce them to remain at Dew etsdorp until they had been forced to fight or to surrender has been disappointing.
