Winnipeg, Man., May 4.—The machine Liberals, headed by Obed Smith and \ Thos. Green way, held a meeting at Mur- oqo Jen last night, to nominate a candidate against R L. Richardson, in Liagar.
The president of the local association re fused a re-nomination to the office, and demanded to know what Mr. Richardson had done contrary to Liberal principles, except to act as an honest man should.
He was immediately suppressed by the machine, and another man was elected to the chair. This started a general row, in which the machine and the honest Grits were pretty evenly divided, and the meeting dispersed in disorder. Greenway afterwards gave a harangue to those who would listen, but nothing was done toward nominating a candidate. It is the general opinion that Greenway himself is after the candidacy, as a graceful way of retiring from politics. Another meeting will be held at Manitou in the near future, with this end in view.

Sir Charles referred to the period of Canada a history between the years of 1841 and 1807, as a period of isolation when the provinces had dealings with each other, but separated by lack of facilities for communication and by hostile tariffs. They dealt with the states nearest at hand, and not with each other. This period gave way to the period of Confederation and the enormons atrides

The tremendous advance in dairying practice within the past fifteen years lias so revolutionized dairying methods about every live years during such period, that it is necessary, in order to be profitable, that dairying keep pace with advanced conditions. Dairying upon the lines of fifteen years ago is now a losing occupation. Dairying upon the basis of five and ten years ago now does well to make ends meet.

FOR SUNDAY'S ROAST.
There Is nothing which will more quickly dihpel the family appetite than the re-appearance of Sunday's roast in ha original form. Thinly sliced cold meat is not to be despised for supper, but do not let it be seen too often at breakfast. There are so many savory dishes to be devised from a roast that it la quite as great n source of enjoyment us in its first state. Hash has fallen into disrepute, but when properly made it is very good indeed
Try this way : Remove fat and gristle, chop medium fine, and put in aj saucepan with water enough to rome up through it. Let It simmer for a few minutes, then season with salt, pepper and a little chopped parsley. Hub a tubb; spoonful of butter smooth with one and one half teaspoonfuls of flour, pour some of the gravy over this till It Is like thick paste, then stir into the meat. Have ready two hard-boiled eggs for each quart of meat, chop fine, and add Just before serving This is like the famous dish uf the nursery rhyme, " to set before the king."

Does every housekeeper know that hard sauce, that old stand-by, is far better made otf powdered than of granulated sugar Î The latter may be sweeter, but powdered sugar Is sweet enough, and gives a much better texture The proportions to be maintained are twice as much sugar
as butter, and if the sugar reaches three times the amount of butter it wiifl not be to the detriment id the sauce. Cream the butter first, then sift in the sugar, and beat until light ; add the flavoring, heap lightly in a glass dish, and stand in the ioe-box to chill before using.
