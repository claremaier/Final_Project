MILK FOR MAKING GROWTH.
The milk of the Je rat» y and Guernsey breeds of cows average higher in bullet fats than that of the larger breeds. But this richest milk is by no moans the best for babies, and those who, in mistaken kindness, order pure Jersey m.lk, find that it
oeedts to be largely diluted with water or it will curdle* in the stomach. The m.lk is too rich is the reason why Bo many babies sicken when fed on bow’s milk. The m;lk from a mother's breast has less casein and fats than that from a cow. Even for the calf the m.lk from its dam is generally too rich, it will fatten the calf but it will be at the expense of growth
the Jersey breed is under sized is because its calves are for a time allowed to suck undiluted milk from their dams until their digestion is injured.

DRESSING GEESE.
To kill geese, have a place where you can hang them with the head down, and then stick a sharp knife through the neck close to the head, and let them bleed. This causes the meat to be very clean and white. After they are through bleeding, roll them up, one at a time, in three of four thicknesses of blanket, and put
them into a boiler of hot water, letting them remain there about one minufch, nftbetward 1 lutin, where they will drain for about ten minute* more, and then pick them. They will then pick easily. It is the steam that causes the feathers to loosen. It is an everlasting job to dry-jack geese, and thin is a sure process. , The entrails should be immediately removed, the head cut off, and the skin drawn neatly over the neck and tied. Afterwards place them where they will keep cool, out not freeze.

II s very firnt words gave her good oau m for terror, for he roundly stated, in :i very fine nnd imp;easive man ner, that the firiaoner in the dock had no business there at all ; for, that if the detectives hid not blundered and misled justice, another man, and that the really guilty one, would be stand ing there in his place “ The name of that man,”—and here Mr. Lemaire paused, and his scathing eyes found out the French woman where she mat, “ was Janin Pierrot,
Hose Dupont's lover, and Home Du pont’s confederate, the man whom she had assisted to got into the house, whom she had helped to depart, and who had shot Mr. Roms when discovered on the [premises by that gentleman when he returned to the house after Mr. St. George had g me Up to bed.
At this daring indictment, unexpected,. «tartling, a bolt out of the blue, nil eyes were turned on Jack, then on Home, who, cowering am under a crushing physical blow, had crouched down with bowed head in her place every line of her figure a corroboration of bis words. " That woman, ' said Mr.
Lemaire, pointing a terrible finger at her, " laid her plans we.ll. She had by her the chloral ready to mix with her mistress’s night draught, and had long ago arranged the signal by which she was to let her lover know when Mrs. St. George warn sleeping downstairs, alone and unprotected, with the sapphires dome at hand ; and, in short, everything fell out precisely ns she had hoped and intended—with one exception—the unexpected contingency
of Mr. Ross's return. Mrs. St. George duly drank her draught, and went to bed and to sleep ; a notoriously had sleeper she mleptt right away from eleven o’clock that night until eight o’clock the next morn ng ! Mr. St .George in due course went upstairs nnd also retired to rest, not, as that woman with the toothache had sworn, after Mr. Rosa came in, but before.
" The coast was now clear, all was prepared for the thief, Janin Pierrot, and at the given time he stole safely and secretly into the house. Into the hou-ie, yes, hut meanwhile, some one who had not been taken into the woman’s reckoning came in Latchkey, and in the act of undressing, hearing movements below, for which ho could not account, probably the noise made by the man’s getting through the window, descended quickly, and found himself face to face with an intruder, who, having come for plunder, was betrayed by personal jeopardy and fear of consequences into murder. Mr. Ross always carried firearms ; in this instance he carried a pistol belonging to Mr. St. George and it wavt natural enough that he should present the weapon he bad with him at tho man he found there under Much desperate circumstances at such an hour of the night.
" That man," went on Mr. Lemaire,

Canada holds the key, the open sesame to the great future transportation route across this continent and between theeast-and western markets of the world, and that route is destined to carry the immense agricultural and mineral production of the western portion of our territories as well as that of the Northern States to the world’s An important factor in that line of communication, made, will be the future canal route now called the Ottawa, Montreal & Georgian Bay canal. Thia route from Georgian Bay will follow the French river to Lake Nipiseing,
Lake Nipissing, then following the Mat tawa river to the Ottawa river and thence to the St. Lawrence and Montreal. It may be divided into two parts, that al ready constructed and in operation, that is from Montreal to Ottawa, and that yet to be constructed, viz: from Ottawa to the Georgian Bay.
The utilization of this highway ie not of recent date. It was the channel of communication between the eastern and west-tribes of Indians, hundreds of years before the advent of the white man to this continent.
In 1(115 the great Champlain traversed this route and won the distinction of being the first European to view the great waters of our inland seas. Subsequently it became the principal route of the Hud Bay company for carrying on their immensely profitable trading with the native Indians. A brief study of the map will show to the intelligent observer the importance of its geographical position, and indicate the directness of this route between our vast inland fresh water seas and the Atlantic seaboard. Its advantage in this respect over others that are claiming attention may be shown by a parison of mileage. For instance, the dis from Chicago to Montreal is, by

The Mayor of Renfrew for 1900 is Mr.
Harry Musi.
Tom Payment, of Ottawa hie got there for tho et con d time as he said he would, defeating ex-Alderman Campbell.
Oobden'e young men had a concert last week, the proceeds of which wore to be devoted to the establishment of a public library in that thriving village. The mum real zid, together with what was on band for that purpose, amounts to $50. A meeting will shortly be called to devise means to inertase this sum.
Tho Pembroke Observer reports that Mr. Isidore Deni erne, of Allumette Inland discovered a hole in the ground some days ago, and judged that skunks had their home there. He procured a long, slender pole, put a hook on the end of it, and pulled out no less than ten skunks from the nest. These were killed and skinned, and the skin will bring *5.00.
The hero of this adventure must assuredly have had a highly flavored experience.
The interprovincial bridge will probably be opened for treflic early in June or July. The atone work is completed and the company has commenced the erection of the first span on the Hull side. It is a massive piece of iron work, 140 feet in length and gives the long-talked-of structure an t fleetivc semblance of reality. As soon as the remainder of the iron superstructure is completed by the Dominion Bridge company,it will be forwarded here and work on its erection will be pushed through the winter months. The job is a particularly heavy one, but a sufficiently large stiff will be employed to facilitate the work.
_	, A strong effort will be made to have the

passenger traffic by July.

The entire sales so far as known were to Canadians although some of them may have beem acting for American firms. The prices realized were quite up to what the government authorities expected, the total bonuses amounting to $723,550, an average of $2,000 per square mile. Three hundred and sixty square miles out of 398J were disposed of.
