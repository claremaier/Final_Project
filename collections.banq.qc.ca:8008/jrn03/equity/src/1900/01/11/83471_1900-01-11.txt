An Improbable Story From a Vermont Town.
Burlington, Yt., Jan. 3.—It is reported ou excellent authority that the Fenians are engaged in storing vast quantities of dynamite, lyddite, ammunition and supplies in a few selected depositories in remote rural districts in Vermor.tand Maine, near the Canadian boundary. This is the most active move yet taken in the reported plans for the invasion of Canada. The information is given out by persons who claim to know of the purchase of some of the supplies and by otlnrs who learned of their being shipped as groceries.
Dynamite and lyddite have been secured in surprisingly large quantities and secreted in excavations and caves on the Vermont birder,while great quantities of canned meats have been hidden in the barns of sympathizing farmers on the Maine line near New Hampshire. A large and efficient ambulance corps is being organized under the supervision of a few

Mr. Fletcher Warren of Allumette Island was last week appointed local agent of the Massey-Harris Co. in Pembroke, to take the place of Mr. J. S. Sparling, who has been promoted to the position of travelling special sales agent. Mr. \N ar-ren will be found at the old stand occupied by J.S. Sparling, and will at once remove his family to town. Mr. W J Best, manager at Ottawa, was in Pembroke last week making a selection. Twenty four applications for the position had been sent in in response to the advertisement in the Observer, from east, west, north and south. It is believed that Mr. Warren will make an excellent and efficient agent; he is a hustler. Mr. Sparling started on his first trip since assuming his new office on Monday rf this week, and the Company may expect good results.—Pembroke Observer.

In view of the general belief that Austria Hungary cannot be held together after the death of Francis Joseph the question arises, What will be the effect of the disintegration ef the dual monarchy upon ne.ghbor-|ug nations! An answer to t: Is quvs tiou Is attempted in an interesting article entitled "L Europe sans l'Autriche,*' which M. Charles Benoist has contributed to a recent number of the Rwue des Deux hi ondes. The merit of the article consists in hs demonstration that the process of sympathetic gravitation can never be thoroughly carried out owing to geographical obstructions. The lines of race sleavage in Austria Hungary do nut run true. / Thus the frontier of a greater Germany would, if it were to take in the main blocks of German population have either to include Ho Hernia, cutting off the Czech inhabitants of that kingdom from the Slavs of Silesia or A*oravia, or else to curve around it, leaving Bohemia as a wedge between Germau territories.

A CARVING LESSON
A saddle of mutton should be carved in long slices, half lean, half fat. A cut should be made down the whole length parallel with the backbone ,and slices cut diagonally froiui the centre of the bank to the end of the ribs. A leg of mutton should be held with the forks so that the inner side is toward the carver; the knife must be inserted near the thickest part, but must not cut through to the bone. The slices should not be too thin, but rather wedge shaped, the first one not being removed till two or three insertions luive been made. The knuckle end is more glutinous than the other, and is consequently regarded by some as a delicacy. When the centre of the meal is Insufficiently cooked to please the guest, the knuckle end will often b found in much more suitable condition. lu carving a loin a chop should be given to each person.
A shoulder of mutton is as easy to manipulate, once the right side to cut onlsts of the thirteenth century, who be decided ou; this can easily be as-dwell in Transylvania, on the eastern cert mined by trying where the fork aide of Hungary.

Sherlock, the gallant little Lancer trumpeter, whose recent exploit at Elandhlnagte has taken England by dorm I a na Ive of Caolei bui y, w here his moi her is now liv ing. He joined his regiment, the 5th . sincere, about eighteen, months ago in Natal, having been, went out from the depot at Can-teibury. lie la deacribed aa a rosy-cheeked, healthy looking boy, and ia a great favourite in the regiment.
His exploit naturally gives rise to the query, "Is it possible for a boy of fourteen to be on duty with hi* regiment on motive service?'1 ft ia, and tb* following lines will show how.
According to the Army Regulations no boy can enlist as trumiwter under fourteen years of age. Ho is then put under the charge of the Fergeant-trumpeter, mui provided he shows average adaptability to learn the différant calls, is in about four months' time competent to act as garrison trumpeter; in other words, he has acquired the necessary culls for use In garrison only. x
Hut ho has yet much to learn, remurks the London Mail, it will take him, as a rule, another four months before ho has throughly mastered every call that a trumpeter has to sound in garrison and on active service, of which there are a hundred and fifty.

The British find themselves in culiar position in their warfare with the Boers. England at The Hague signed an agreement nut to use ballot V for the launching of projectiles and e: *v x^ys. The Boers, not having been reprit*ted at the Peace Conference, are not bound by any such agreement, but if they should resort to measures of this kind Great Britain has an ace up her sleeve that would be highly effective in ending the game

The fact that General White
managed recently to send a dispatch from the beieagured town of Ladysmith to Durban by means of carrier pigeons once more demonstrates the servi c that these birds may be in time of war even in these days of telegraphy, wireless and otherwise.
The attention of European nations to "homing" or "carrier" pigeons as an adjunct to their armies may be said to have first been excited in 1870, when, thanks to the existence of one or two societies for tlie flying and training of these birds in Paris during the days of the siege, the inhabitants of the city were ubie to communicate with their friends in the country. The method adopted for the conveyance of these messages in small as not to impede the birds iu their flight was most ingenious sages were not allowed to exceed 20 words, and these were photographed in microscopic characters on collodion films, each of which bore some hundreds of these messages, and as each

FUT THEM TO SLEEP
While societies for the breeding and j their own lives, improvement of pigeons exist in all countries, It is Belgium which produces the best birds.
The messages to be sent by the birds are usually attacked to them n one of two ways, either to the under por- hi* iealynl* #f K**i wd’% Preseal Fee la non of the tail feathers or to one of their legs, and by these means the birds can carry long messages without being unduly hampered by them, is usual to send the same message by j deeply religious; piofoundly ignorant; several birds, so* that one, at llaet, w assured of reaching its destination.

When liberated the birds usually circle around their temporary home for some few moments in aimless fashion, and then set off in the direction of the place from which th y have been brought. While they bava been known to fly at the rate of 10U miles an hour, their u>ual speed is abiut a third of that.

It is difficult to see now an army could be lulled into slumber w thout the oxygen in the atmosphère be.ng destroyed, but the resources of chemistry are so vast that it would be idle to indulge in any guesses on the subject. Another thing which appears curious, is that, as the object of this gas was not to kill, hut to render unconscious, what possible objection could be offered to its use?
If its introduction had been generally sanctioned the whole art of war would soon be revolutionized Disputes could then be decided by battles in which the loss of life would be small. The implements of war would remain practically the same, but the object of either side would be to hurl the shells, which, exploding, would immediately plunge the entire army in insensibility.
If both succeeded, operations would have to be suspended till the warriors came to, and this might be repented again and again till one mid* failed. Whichever army eventually w n, the result could be secured without loss "f life. Why 24 Powers out of 20 should have agreed at The Hague not to resort to asphyxiating gases, and yet decline to interdict submarine boats is astonishing.
If they argued for the exclusion of asphyxiating gas on the ground that its use would injure the material spirit of an army, something, although not much, might, be said for such an argument. But the members of n Pence Conference could not decently may anything in favor of martial spirit, and that being so, it does seem inconsistent that the very body who voted against the use of asphyxiating gases should yet legalize submarine boats, able to sink in an instant, the strongest ironclad ever made.

PRO-BOER SENTIMENT
ta

Considerable of it in British Columbia’s Capital.
Victoria, P», C , Jan. 3.—Great indig
nation is felt here as a i t suit of facts which came to light yesterday. It appears that the pro-B ier sympathies of a largo number of the natives of Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have been but ill concealed and at last resulted in a gathering been convened to discuss the situation. At this meeting a well known sealing captain of this port, and himself a Swede, is said to have presided, while the sentiments of all present were decid edly anti-British. They expressed them selves as willing to contribute of their means to help the Boer cause and assist the families of the Boers who fall in battle. Before the meeting broke up a tidy sum was subscribed and ordered to be for» warded via Holland to England’s enemies in South Africa. The matter is all the more notorious ns the gentleman who presided is himself a British citizen, and is said to own some of the houses occupied by the British regular officers at work in barracks. One of those who was present at the meeting entered the store of a Yorkshire auctioneer in this cily today, and airing his Boer proclivities taunted the auctioneer with the failure of his countrymen to defeat the Boers. He was warned that if he persisted in his remarks, corporal punishment would be administered, but ho persisted, whereupon he was felled to the floor by a blow from the Englishman's fist. It is a do bated question whether the authorities should not intervene to prevent such treasonable gatherings. The Scandinavian population of this city is not so large but the majority of them are pro Bier.
Victoria, B. C., Jan. 4. -A cit'zm committee was formed here yesterday to ascertain identify to all Boer sympathizers identified with Transvaal assistance movement, and to institute prosecutions for treason ; also arranging a boycott. The movement, which has excited great indig nation, is chiefly among German, Dutch and Belgian residents.

New York, Jan. 6.—The Southern Presbyterian Board of Missionsat Nashville, Tunn., says a special to the Times from that city, has received letters from the Rev. L. V. Y ass, and the Rev. 11. P. Hawkins, missionaries of the church sta tinned at Luebo, Congo Free State, Africa, giving accounts of the burning of fourteen villages and killing of ninety or more natives by state troops. They report that some of the victims were eaten by cannibals, and that the bodies of all who were slain were mutilated, their heads being cut off.
The Rev. W. II. Sheppard, when the news of the massacre reached the mission was sent to investigate and on arriving at the camp of the Z ippo Zaps, in the Rena cam ha county, found the story to be true and saw forty seven dead, three of whom were eaten.
The chief said that eighty or ninety had been killed and tivo persons eaten hy the I>eople. Mr. Sheppard saw eighty one right hands cut off and drying over a slow fire, in order to lie afterwards taken back to the state officers. Sixty women prisoners were confined in a pen, and sixteen men had already been sent away prisoners.
It is said the raid was ordered because the people could not pay the exorbitant tribute demanded by the state.

London, Jan. 4.—The bearing of the Canadians under their first baptism of fire at Sunnyside is warmly applauded by the press generally.
The Times says: “ The mother country shares with Canadians and Australians the pride and gratifications at the fine qualit* les displayed in the dashing little engagement. The conduct of both contingent* was most soldierly, and is an earnest of what the behavior of all the colonial forces will be on many a hard fought field under the old flag.
