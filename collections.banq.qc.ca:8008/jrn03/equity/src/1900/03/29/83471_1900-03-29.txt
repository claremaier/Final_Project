Mr. Poupore, who had charge of the bill, offered an amendment that the company commence building the extension from Waltham to Ferguson’s Point before constructing the branch from Shawvüle to Pembroke, crossing the Ottawa river near Bryson. Mr. Puupore explained that the extension from Wal than* to Pembroke across Allumette Island, would be dropped if the branch from Shawville to Pembroke was granted.
Mr. H. J. Beemer opposed the amend ment, staring that ho had already got the Pont iso and Pacific into deep water in endeavoring to meet the views of the people of Pontiac. Something had to bo done notv to place the road in a better finanç ai pos-tinn. The construction of the branch to Pembroke would do this.

After a session of <’»5 days the Legislature of this province was prorogued on Friday last, with the usual ceremonies.
The bill passed by the Legislative Assembly to abolish the Legislative Council, was promptly killed by the bon. gentleman of the second chamber, after due discussion.
Evidently the M. L. C’a. think they are too valuable an adjunct to province’s gubernatorial machinery to snuff themstlves * out of existence. The vote in the Council on the question stood as follows: —

Hon. Mr, Fielding delivered his budget
speech on Friday last. The important
feature of its contents was the announce
ment that the tariff preference on British
goods is to be in increased to 33 - percent. In other words, preferred (British )articles are to be admitted into Canada at one-third less duty than the produces of other countries, befoie this change the preference was 25 per cent, which however, did not accomplish the results that were expected from it, the importations of British goods, showing no appreciable increase, while those from the United States con tinued to grow in volume. The new an rangement may work more satisfactorily, but a strong contention prevails that it will not. The budget shows the country to bo iu a prosperous condition, the vol unie of trade having increased remarkably and naturally the sequence of this satisfactory condition gives largely increased revenues,—more money for government expenditure, and from the enormous es timutes that have been brought down, there is no question that spent it will be.

The Liberal Government of Prince Edward Inland, which it continuing to mismanage the affairs of that province, despite the fact that it no longer enjoys the con I ?idence of the electors, hare recently worked a very cute little wrinkle which will enable them to hold on to the strings of office for some little time at least. A short time ago a man named Pineau defeated the government's candidate in a by election, and this practically defeated it. The government, however, did not resign, as in all decency they should have done, but instead, they got hold of Mr. Pineau and, so the story goes, bargnned with him for a consideration, to keep away from the Legislature at the session then approaching, and thus unembarrased by his presence they would be enabled to pull through. Pineau took the bait, and suddenly dim

It is said that L>rd Metheun will have a large force placed at his disporal and that he may make an advance northward simultaneously with that of Lord Roberts 520p.m. by way of Klerksdorp to Johannesburg, 9..Ua.m, ! partially following the n ote of the Jameson expedition.
The Ladysmith garrison should be ready to resume service about the beginning of April. General Bui er will then have a force of four infantry divisions and one cavalry division, besides a large number of colonial mounted infantry, in all about 40,000 men with 120 guns. He will this be stronger then the whole boer army now in the field.
Hie task will be to turn the Biggaroberg defences and then advance direct upon the Transvaal, occupying the attention of 4 large number of Boers to the east, w hile Lord Roberts moves on Pretoria.	I
By that time Lord Roberts will have s I been reinforced by Generals Clements, MO G at acre and Brabant, having about 00,;;	;	000 men and CWguna. With the country
