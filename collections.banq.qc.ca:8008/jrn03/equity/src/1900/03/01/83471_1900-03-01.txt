NEVER GO RACK ON A FRIEND
Though your friends may be few, Let them feel that in you And your word they can ever depend ; To preserve your good name,
From contumely and shame.

The next morning at daybreak, we were on the road to Douglas, 23 miles away, and we expected to have another scrap but when we got there after a terrible march in the dust and heat we found the Doers had retreated to the Modder River and our country to Douglas was unopposed. The papers praised our work, but if we did not have a great fight we did as we were told, and the English Colonel gave its great praise.
We stayed at Douglas all night, and had a fine swim in the Vaal River. We were the first of the Canadians under tiro and No 3 section (the one I was in) happened to see most of the fighting. Hamilton, the Globe reporter, was with No. 3 all through the fight, so you will see a full report of our skirmish in the Globe.

We may bo mistaken, but it seems to us the facts bear out the pretension that it takes a peculiar people indeed to elect to Parliament nuisances of the Dr. Laud erkin type. If the electors of his borough cannot find it in their hearts to leave him at homo next election, it is to be hoped the “machine" will be1detailed to hug the political life out of him.

There is one important feature connected with the Georgian Bay canal which ia of paramount importance not only to tho Dominion at large, but also to the pro. vincoi of Ontario and Quebec. It is that tho early opening up of the Ottawa water route will be an immense factor in forming a poweiful immigration agency.
When tho Rideau canal was built a large number of sappers and miners came out with Col By and received their discharge, took up land and settled here. The immigrants also, who landed in this district during the c instruction of that canal and received employmentonthe works, bought lands and settled on both side; of the Rideau river and canal from Ottawa to Kingston. Now their descendants, theirchild-reu's children, are happy, prosperous and contented farmer citizens of this fair Dominion.

The sad yet glorious fate of a score of our brave young men who left the shores of Canada in October last to do battle for the empire and uphold the great princip lea of right and justice to all, brings before the minds of the Canadian people a fuller and more vivid realization of the horrors of war than any of the previous occurences which has marked the present sanguinary struggle between Briton and Boer.
The bitter sting of the conflict has touched the hearts of some of our fellow citizens, and from tho long list of wound ed reported it ia only reasonable to expect that still further vacancies in Canadian homes will result, and thus the wave of morrow will become more far-reaching and its depressing effect more general; and while at,II the great majority of ua are spared the anguish of losing a loved one on that distant field of strife, upon which the eyes of the universe are fixed, the sympathies of all, who have within their breasts the impress of loyalty and devotion to our common interests, must un

One evening last week Grade, daughter of Mr. Thomas Graham, had a somewhat startling and what might have proved very painfull experience, says the Smith’s Falls News. She was sitting near a stove wading a book, her head somewhat near th> fire.

Theory will, therefore, be merely •n elect oriel one.
