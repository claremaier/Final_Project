He went on to point that the people of New York had become exercised in regard to the Canadian waterways; realizing that they must wake up or the trade would be found coming down the S%
Lawrence, and he hoped, the 0;tawa.
He quoted several reports made to the New York Legislature. Among them a message sent by Governor Roosevelt drawing attention to the competition offered by the Canadian canal system.
It was pointed out that a mistake had been made in neglecting their waterways and allowing the transport facilities to pass into the hands rf railway combines, as by water the traflic could be handled at one-fourth the cost. There was an answer to Mr. Osier. His object was to show the necessity of improving our waterways and the facilities at Montreal.

I listened with much pleasure to the speech of the lion, member for Toronto (Mr. Clarke) in which he said, that his constituents, one and all, were quite prepared to contribute their portion towards paying all the expenses of the Canadian contingents in South Africa. I want to say, Sir, that a similar feeling exists in the good old county of Pontiac. There is not a single ratepayer in that county, but who would not hold up both hands in favour of contributing his quota towards paying all the expenses of the Canadian contingent. Now, a good

HOW Til! RELIEF MOVEMENT WAS KXEWT
SU.
Of the actual relief of the place, Winston Churchill sends an interesting account in which ho rays; “During the afternoon of the 28th, cavalry brigades pressed forward from Murdock toward Dulwana HiP, under Dundonald, in the direction of Ladysmith. The Boers tired on the advancing troops with artillery stationed on Dulwana Hill.
| “About 4 p. rn. Major Hough’s regiment, which warn in advance, found that the ridges surrounding and concealing Ladysmith were apparently unoccupied. Lie reported this to Dundonald, who thereupon determined to ride through the gap and reach the town with two squadrons of the imperial Light Horse and Carbineers. The rest of the brigade was sent back to Gen. Bullet's picket line. When we atari cd for Ladysmith there was only an hour of daylight left.
“The troops galloped on swiftly in spite of the rough ground up and down hill, through dongas and scrub oak, till they could see the British guns flashing from Wagon Hill. Then it was on faster till suddenly therm was n challenge : “ goes there l'
