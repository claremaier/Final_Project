Canadian Boys the Best Distance Runners in the States.
Dick Grant, the famous distance runner, visited his brother, Alexander, at the University of Pennsylvania yesterday. He was on his way lack to Boston from Washington, where he met and defeated Alexander in a two-nule special The two brothers are an interesting pair. They stand in the front rank of amateur distance runners of America, their only competitors being Cregan, of Princeton, and Orton, of Pennsylvania. Their home is in St. Mary’s, Canada, where they wore born and raised. They first attended school at the University of Toronto. Several times they co\ered the distance between Toronto and their home, about 125 miles, on foot. The Toronto
papers, speaking of Dick Grant, say that
he often ran home for breakfast.
Since they have been tn the States, Alexander has been the winner in every meet, with few exceptions. Dick is the older of the two and while in Canada was the better runner, but since Mike Mur ,,hy has had charge of Alexander he has developed wonderfully. Grant, of Bar vard v. Grant, of Pennsylvania have often been the attraction at athletic meets, and these two names always assured a good race. Last summer they ran a dead heat in the five-mile championship, and their
