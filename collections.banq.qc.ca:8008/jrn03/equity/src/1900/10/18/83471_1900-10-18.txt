The gentlemen composing the convention were undoubtedly representative so far as the term applies to the particular locality from which they came, coupled with their own individuality ; but further than that they represented nobody in particular. So far as we can learn no meetings of electors were he'd in any of the polling divisions for the purpose of giving the electors an opportunity of appointing delegates to at* tond a convention ; but instead was adopted a surer plan of picking out those in the different divisions who were known

But there were Liberals there which even all these brilliant pyrotechnics of Mr. Murray failed to enthuse, and there were a good many strong old-time Liberals, too, who were also conspicuous.

As an evidence ot the benefits of Lib
i one is
era! rule, Mr. C. B. Taggart, in his speech last Thursday pointed to the prosperity which existed in the village of Shawville, and the good markets that have been created here fur the products of the farmer. We have always thought, and we fancy the most of our citizens hold the same opinion that the progress Shawville has made is due largely if not altogether, to the advantages it has obtained over other places in consequence of its better railway facilities and its location in a populous district. Did the Liberals have anything to do with bringing abiut these conditions ? Not one iota more than they had to ensure the good crops of the present year. And as to the good home market—why, that has existed for the past ten years, the only difference being that it has increased by reason of the greater number of people who come here now to deal than formerly, and if Shaw ville has been gaining in this respect it is •elf-evident that other places which have not our advantages must be the losers. Now as to prices : We have resurrected a few old newspaper files just to see how they compare. In the year 1894 we find the Shawville produce quotations were as follows : Oats, 30 to 32 cents ; pease, 48 to 50 cents ; buckwheat, 40 to 42 cents ; eggs, 9 to 10 cents ; butter, 12 to 13

“ When combines arc formed raise the pi ice of any article beyond the proper price, he was prepared, although a firm believer in a pteffective tariff, to remove that protection and force the combines to
to be safe for the Murray ticket. Herce it is not at all surprising that the utmost harmony prevailed when this assembly met to deliberate. Hitherto it has been the rule with the Liberals of Pontiac to hold open conventions, but for obvious reasons that custom was departed from in this instance. Doubtless having in mind the way things fizzled out at the open convention of 1890, when Dr. Gab oury stepped into the gap, after Mr. Gillies, Mr. G. E. Held, Mr. G. F. Hodgins and others politely declined to touch it, notwithstanding the earnest solicitations of their admirers,—Mr. Murray—wary politician that he is—foresaw that friction was imminent if the same methods of

opinion, that the present leaders of the Liberal party, Sir Wilfrid Laurier and hia colleagues in the Cabinet (or at least 1 ' much of them as were members of the Liberal party when in opposition,) have betrayed the principles of our party, been false to their pledges, and broken faith with the people of Canada.

I make this charge with a full consciousness of its seriousness,, and of the personal responsibility I assume in making it ; but I make it, believing that a* one whose efforts, however feeble and humble they may have been, were exerted four years ago, towards putting these men in the positions they occupy and have disgraced, . 1 can only escape from sharing their guilt by thus publicly denouncing and repudiating them.
