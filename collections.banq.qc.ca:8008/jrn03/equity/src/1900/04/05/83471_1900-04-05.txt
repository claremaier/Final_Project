“ That this House is of opinion that a system of mutual trade preference between Great Britain and Ireland and the colonies would greatly stimulate increased production in trade and commerce between these countries, and would thus promote and maintain the unity of the Empire, and that nothing which falls short of the complete realization of such a policy should be considered as final and satisfactory.

The Manitoba Legislature opened on Thursday last. The bill of fare prepared by the recently installed administration by the Hon. Hugh John McDonald, as outlined in the speech from the throne, deals with the financial condition of the province, which ta stated to be unsatisfac tory. It promises a measure for the prohibition of the liquor traffic, in response to the twice expressed wish of the people on that subject; also measures dealing with the liabilities of factory employers, and providing for the adequate protection of those employed in factories; a bill to repeal the present unsatisfactory election act, and to enact instead thereof a simpler and more just law; a bill consolidating and amending the real property act, and 1 other measures. The speech also states that certain orders in council passed by 1 the Green way Government, granting aid ! to railways, will not be ratified by the ' present administration.	I
