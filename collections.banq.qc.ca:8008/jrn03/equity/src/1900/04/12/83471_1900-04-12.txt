It is certainly too bad that the people of the upper end have been denied railway facilities so long, while year by year they are contributing to the building of I a road which does not benefit them; but unfortunately the fact remains that more miles of railway are now in operation in the County than were called for by the terms of the bonus by law, and therefore no legal obligation exists obliging the company to lay another rail if they decide not to do mo.
With regard to these amendments to the charter of the P. P. J. Railway Company, it may be stated that Mr. Beemer explained before the committee when the bill was under discussion, that his object in seeking the amendments, was to obtain the power to construct a charter, leas expensive and better paying route to Pembroke than by the old proposed route. By procuring this concession, it would enable the Company to get out of the deep water in which it had all along been struggling, the roid would be placed on a much better footing financially, dnd the Company would be in a much better post* tion to undertake the extension of the

FURNITURE DEALER AND
UNDERTAKER,
The question of preferential trade between Canada and Great Britain ptonv isi:8 to become a definite and clear-cut issue between the two great political parties of Canada The Liberal Leaders, who are not fond, now a-days, of defining their policies, have managed, nevertheless, to place themselves on record against any attempt to secure for the farmers of Canada any preference in the British market, and have done much to make it difficult to obtain any preferential treatment in the United Kingdom. The Conservative leaders have declared thorn- | selves squarely in favour of obtaining such a preference. The question of great importance to Canada now, and promises to become of vital importance in the near future. The present is a time of exceptional world-wide commercial activity, and, in the nature of things, cannot be expected to last long. Tariff conditions, which are tolerable when manufacturers in one country are so busy providing for their own home market that they are not tempted to enter into cut-throat competitions with manufacturers in another country, may become intolerable during the next period of world-wide depression.
A very small preference in the British market in favour of Canadian bread-stuffs would enhance the value of every acre of farm land in the Dominion, would enrich onr farmers and till up our waste lands with the very best class of irami-

line westward from Waltham, which they intended to do.
The people of the upper end may not regard the arrangement that was made with approval; yet after all it seems to us it affords them the only prospect of getting a railway which exists. There was nothing to be gained in blocking Mr.
Beemer’s scheme to reach Pembroke by a more direct and less expensive route Certainly it would not hasten the construction of the line from Waltham westward. In fact the chances are the charter covering that portion of the road would be allowed to lapse, in which event
where would a company be found that ject of the promoters pf the resolution was
to make closer the union of the colonies with the the mother country they could 1 r.e oser the same ground . timer ex- | have no more strenuous supporter than
isting conditions, and in view of the great expense that it would involve, it is quite safe to assume that no company would be forthcoming to attempt it.
There is no question, however, that the road can be extended to Ferguson’s Point at a comparatively low cost, save for the bridging of Black River; but the P. P. J. Company are the only people who are, from the existing nature of things, in a position to undertake it, and as they have signified their intention to go on with it after they complete the proposed line to Pembroke, as the clause
