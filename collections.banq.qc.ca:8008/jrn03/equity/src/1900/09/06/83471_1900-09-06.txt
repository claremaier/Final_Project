Edey.— Elizabeth A. Edey, whoœ maiden name was Belcher, was born in Clarendon, I*. G., Jan. 20, 1802, and entered into rent June 15, 1900. She joined the English church in youth and continued a member thereof until after lier marriage in November, 1882, to Mr. Elliott Edey, who being a member of the Methodist Church, «he united with him, and remained a member of that body until she wan called to the Church Triumphant. Alxuit two years ago she whh led to more fully surrender herself to Christ and to enter into the experience of entire sanctification. Her Christian life was marked by strong faith, by a clear and decided testimony to the sav ing power of Christ and by a most patient resignation to the will of God. Although anxious to live for the sake of her family, yet when her sorrowing was enabled to give her up she was then anxious to go and be with Jesus. With sister Edey it was no uncertainty, to be absent from the body was to he present with the Lord. Those who were with her in the last hours of her earthly pilgrimage say it was a most triumphant death.
It was a pleasure to visit her as it always left an influence for good to be in conversation with her, and in leaving room one always felt he had been in the presence of a holy person. She wat never harsh in her judgment of others, but ever expressed the hope that all Christians might be led up to the full measure of their possibilities in Christ. A sorrowing husband, one s n and two daughters are left to mourn her loss. The deepest sympathy of the community is extended to them. About 100 carriages formed the procession which followed her to her last resting place on Sunday morning, June 17, 1000.

While in that locality they had the pleasure of calling on the Carsons and had dinner with Thos. Clarke and Arthur Richards, who, of course, were rejoiced to see them. The returned travellers report that the boys have as fine a farm as they saw anywhere in the Northwest, and that they are well satisfied with the venture.

The tilling of an order of 29,000 pairs of moccasins for the British Government, for the use of troops in China has cleared out every moccasin in the province of Quebec, so an Ottawa paper reports. This is not strictly correct. We know of several pairs that have don# service with members of the Kazubazua Hunt Club, that are still to be reckoned with — somewhat weather-beaten and distorted in shape, it is true, hut moccasins still.

Farm for Sale
Sunday was the hottest day of the season so far as Shawville and vicinity were concerned. There was a stiff breeze during the greater jwirt of tho day, but it was like the breath of a furnace -a taste of the western chinooks—raising immense clouds of dust that made travelling very disagreeable.
Labor day —Monday—was observed in the literal sense of the term in Shawville. Save the bank, every other place of business was open, and the regular routine of trade and barter was rigidly adhered to Had it been otherwise the number of farmers who came into town on that day would have been disappointed.
